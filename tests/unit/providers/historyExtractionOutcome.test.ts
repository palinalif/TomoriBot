 * Regression guard for the history-extraction failure channel.
 *
 * `extractHistoryWindowForProvider` used to return a bare `HistoryMemoryEntry[]`, so a
 * provider error and a genuinely empty window were both reported as `[]`. `/memory history
 * import` then rendered its "No Facts Extracted" terminal for real provider failures,
 * hiding the actual cause (typically a model that cannot emit structured output).
 *
 * These tests pin the discriminated outcome that keeps the two cases distinguishable.
