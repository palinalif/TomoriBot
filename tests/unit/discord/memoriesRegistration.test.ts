/**
 * `/memories` absorbed roots that formerly had opposite registration shapes, and the resulting
 * permission is the one thing an implementation summary can describe correctly while being wrong.
 * Shared memory teaching must remain reachable to non-managers under `server_memteaching_enabled`,
 * while the Short-Term category remains manager-gated in the route layer.
 * The sibling `/providers` panel exports `managerOnly = true`, so copying it would
 * silently remove teaching from every non-manager in every guild with nothing failing. This gate
 * lives outside the implementation slice for that reason: the manager check for the Short-Term
 * category belongs in the route layer, not in the command's registration.
