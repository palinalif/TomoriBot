# TomoriBot Reference TTS Servers

These scripts are optional local wrapper servers for Phase 4 speech endpoints. They expose TomoriBot's `POST /synthesize` contract and keep model weights outside the Bun app.

Each engine lives in its own subfolder with its own `.venv` to keep dependencies isolated:

| Engine | Folder | Default port |
|---|---|---|
| Chatterbox (Turbo by default, English, bracket tags) | `chatterbox/` | 8011 |
| Qwen3-TTS 12Hz 1.7B Base (10 languages, plain text) | `qwen3tts/` | 8012 |
| Irodori-TTS 500M v2 (Japanese, emoji tags) | `irodoritts/` | 8013 |

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **CUDA 12.x + drivers** *(optional)* — required for GPU acceleration; without it servers fall back to CPU (significantly slower)

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

Run these commands from the repo root. Swap in the folder name for the engine you want.

```powershell
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment inside the engine folder
python -m venv scripts\tts\chatterbox\.venv
scripts\tts\chatterbox\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# 2. Upgrade pip
python -m pip install -U pip

# 3. Install dependencies
#    Chatterbox: install numpy first (pkuseg build-time dependency)
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install -r scripts\tts\chatterbox\requirements.txt

# 4. (GPU only) Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support — skip for CPU-only installs
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

# 5. Start the server
python scripts\tts\chatterbox\server.py
```

> **CUDA version**: use `cu118` or `cu121` in the index URL above if your driver targets an older toolkit.

For other engines, replace `chatterbox` with `qwen3tts` or `irodoritts` throughout. The numpy pre-install is only needed for Chatterbox.

## Registering in TomoriBot

After the server is running, register it with `/config custom-endpoint add`:

- `capability = speech`
- `api_style = tts-clone`
- `endpoint_url = http://127.0.0.1:<port>`
- `script_markup` — select the correct option for the engine (bracket-tags for Chatterbox, plain for the others)

> **ffmpeg required**: voice sample uploads are normalised to WAV via ffmpeg. Install it
> and ensure `ffmpeg` is on your PATH before running `/config speech voice-add`.

Chatterbox defaults to Turbo. Use `/speech chatterbox parameters` to disable Turbo and send standard-model `cfg_weight` and `exaggeration` values with generated voice messages.
