 * Per-key translation provenance, derived from Git history rather than a committed manifest.
 *
 * The sibling question ("is this value byte-identical to English?") answers whether a string was
 * ever translated. This module answers a different one: a string that reads as a real translation
 * can still be stale, because the English it was written against has moved since. Nothing in the
 * working tree records that relationship, so it has to be recovered from history.
 *
 * The baseline for one locale key is the commit that last changed that key's own translated line,
 * which `git blame` reports exactly. The English file at that commit is therefore the English the
 * translator was looking at, and comparing it against the current English file separates a
 * translation that is merely old from one that matched English all along.
 *
 * File-level last-touch dates were tried first and rejected: they report zero drift in this
 * repository because most locale commits move both trees at once. Per-key provenance survives that
 * shape, since a key the translator did not touch keeps its older line commit when a neighbour in
 * the same file is retranslated.
