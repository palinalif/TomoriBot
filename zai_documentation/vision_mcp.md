# Vision MCP Server

<Info>
  Vision MCP Server is a Z.AI capability implementation based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing powerful Z.AI GLM-4.6V capabilities for MCP-compatible clients such as Claude Code and Cline, including image analysis, video understanding, and other features.
</Info>

**NPM Package**: [@z\_ai/mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@z_ai/mcp-server) \
**Prerequisites**: [Node.js >= v22.0.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

<Tip>
  Please install the latest version(>= 0.1.2) of the vision mcp server to experience the GLM-4.6V capability. \
  Existing users might still be using a cached older version. Please clear the npx cache, or append the `@latest` tag to `z_ai/mcp-server` to force-install the newest version (i.e., `z_ai/mcp-server@latest`).
</Tip>

## Product Overview

<Tip>
  This Local MCP Server is an exclusive server developed by Z.AI for **GLM Coding Plan users**, empowering your Code Agent with eyes and limitless vision understanding.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Except in Claude Code, pasting an image directly into the client cannot call this MCP Server, as the client will by default transcode the image and call the model interface directly. \
  The best practice is to place the image in a local directory and invoke the MCP Server by specifying the image name or path in the conversation. \
  For example: `What does demo.png describe?`
</Note>

## Usage Example

<Note>
  Except in Claude Code, pasting an image directly into the client cannot call this MCP Server, as the client will by default transcode the image and call the model interface directly. \
  The best practice is to place the image in a local directory and invoke the MCP Server by specifying the image name or path in the conversation. \
  For example: `What does demo.png describe?`
</Note>

Through the previous step of installing the Vision MCP server to the client, you can directly use MCP in your Coding client. \
For example, in Claude Code, inputting `hi describe this xx.png` in the conversation, the MCP Server will process the image and return the description result. (The prerequisite is that you have the image in your current directory)

## Troubleshooting

Run the following command in your local terminal to verify if it can be installed locally, to troubleshoot environment, permission, and other issues:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Linux/macOS theme={null}
  Z_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key npx -y @z_ai/mcp-server
  ```

  ```cmd Windows Cmd theme={null}
  set Z_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key && npx -y @z_ai/mcp-server
  ```

  ```powershell Windows PowerShell theme={null}
  $env:Z_AI_API_KEY="your_api_key"; npx -y @z_ai/mcp-server
  ```
</CodeGroup>

* If installed successfully, it indicates that the environment is correct, and the issue may be with the client configuration. Please check the client's MCP configuration.
* If installation fails, please troubleshoot based on the error message. It is recommended to paste the error message to a large model for analysis and resolution.

Other common issues:
