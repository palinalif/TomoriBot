 * region is unhealthy, so the failure arrives as a transport error rather than a gateway close
 * code. Retrying is correct for those. A rejected token or an unapproved privileged intent is
 * not: no amount of retrying changes Discord's answer, and a restart loop only hides the
 * misconfiguration behind transport noise.

 * @param error - Failure raised by a gateway connect attempt or by login

 * approval makes the gateway reject the entire connection (DisallowedIntents /
 * WS close 4014). To avoid that (and a failed-then-retried connection), we ask
 * Discord up front whether the intent is enabled for this application.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. Live probe of the application's gateway flags via REST `GET /applications/@me`.
 *      `GatewayPresence` (approved for 100+ guild bots) or `GatewayPresenceLimited`
 *      (enabled for <100 guild bots) means the intent is safe to request. The moment
 *      Discord grants approval, so this flips on the next restart, no code change.
 *   2. On probe failure (e.g. network/REST error), fall back to the legacy default:
 *      enabled outside production, disabled in production.
 *
 * @param environment - Resolved runtime environment (used only for the fallback)
 * @returns true if the GuildPresences intent should be included
