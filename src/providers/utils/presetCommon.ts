Character Name: ${params.characterName}

Character Description:
${params.characterDescription}

How the Character Speaks:
${params.speechExamples}

Instructions:
- Create a rich, detailed character profile in the structured JSON format
- The character should be interesting and engaging for conversation
- Do NOT prepend the sample dialogues with character names or "User:"/"Character:" prefixes - the chat application will handle that
- Use "{user}" as a placeholder when referring to other people or the conversation partner in dialogues
- Use "{bot}" as a placeholder when referring to the character themselves
- Ensure exactly 5 sample dialogue pairs (sample_dialogues_in paired with sample_dialogues_out)

The attribute_list MUST contain exactly 6 items in this exact order:

1. {bot}'s Description: A comprehensive 2-4 sentence description capturing the character's core identity, essence, and overall vibe. What makes them unique? What's their deal?

2. {bot}'s Appearance: Physical description including hair, eyes, clothing, accessories, and any distinctive features. Be specific and vivid.

3. {bot}'s Personality: A comma-separated list of personality traits that define how they think, act, and interact. Focus on specific, actionable traits (e.g., "selective passion, authentic advisor, music obsessive, practical pessimist").

4. {bot}'s Likes: Things, activities, topics, or concepts the character genuinely enjoys or gravitates toward. Can include brief explanations in parentheses.

5. {bot}'s Dislikes: Things, activities, topics, or concepts the character dislikes, avoids, or finds irritating. Can include brief explanations in parentheses or quotes.

6. {bot}'s Behavioral Quirks: Specific mannerisms, speech patterns, habits, or behaviors that make the character distinctive. How do they express themselves? What are their tells?

The sample_dialogues_in and sample_dialogues_out MUST follow this structure (exactly 5 dialogue pairs):

**3 GUIDED SCENARIOS (Required, in this exact order):**

1. **Self-Introduction Request**: User asks {bot} to introduce themselves (e.g., "Can you introduce yourself, {bot}?" or "Who are you?" or "Tell me about yourself")
   - Response should establish identity, tone, core personality, and set expectations
   - This is the character's "first impression" - make it memorable and authentic

2. **Emotional/Personal Scenario**: User shares feelings, asks for advice, or engages emotionally (e.g., "I'm feeling really down today..." or "I'm having relationship problems..." or "Thanks for helping me, {bot}!")
   - Response should demonstrate empathy, emotional intelligence, and how they handle vulnerability
   - Show their relational depth and caring capacity (or lack thereof, if fitting)

3. **Practical/Functional Scenario**: User asks for help, explanation, or practical advice (e.g., "Can you help me understand taxes?" or "How do I fix this problem?" or "What should I do about...")
   - Response should demonstrate competence, knowledge, and helpfulness
   - Show they can actually be useful beyond just personality

**2 FREE SCENARIOS (Your creative choice):**

4. **Free Dialogue #1**: Choose a scenario that showcases a unique character trait, interest, or quirk
   - Examples: Questions about their specific interests/hobbies, unexpected situations, character-specific topics
   - Make it distinctive and memorable - something that reveals depth

5. **Free Dialogue #2**: Choose another scenario that demonstrates different aspects of the character
   - Avoid repeating patterns from previous dialogues
   - Could be humor, vulnerability, expertise, philosophical musings, or anything that adds dimension`;
