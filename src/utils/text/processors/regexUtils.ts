 * "zuhören"). The returned source requires the "u" regex flag on the RegExp it's used in.
 *
 * `\p{M}` is in the class because Discord delivers whatever normalization the sending client
 * used: Apple clients send NFD, where "zuhören" ends in a bare "o" plus a combining diaeresis.
 * Without it the mark itself becomes the fake boundary and the mid-word match survives.
