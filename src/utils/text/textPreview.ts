/**
 * Helpers for rendering user-authored text back to the user inside a Discord
 * notice: either at the moment it is deleted, or to confirm what was just
 * saved.
 *
 * Two problems recur across every command that does this:
 *
 * - **Fence breakout.** The text is interpolated into a locale string that
 *    already owns a code fence. Text containing its own triple backtick closes
 *    that fence early and mangles the rest of the card.
 * - **Dishonest truncation.** Callers slice to a fixed width and either bake a
 *    trailing ellipsis into the locale string unconditionally (claiming
 *    truncation that did not happen) or drop the cut silently.
 *
 * {@link buildTextPreview} solves both, and the shared footer helpers give
 * every call site the same honest "how much was hidden" line.
 *
 * Callers interpolate {@link TextPreview.text} into a locale string that owns
 * the code fence.
