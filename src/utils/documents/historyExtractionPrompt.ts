1. Be a COMPLETE, standalone statement that makes sense without any surrounding context.
2. Replace ALL pronouns (he, she, they, it, etc.) with the actual names or identifiers they refer to.
3. Use ABSOLUTE timestamps (ISO 8601 format) when dates/times are mentioned or can be inferred from message timestamps.
4. Capture the essential meaning without unnecessary filler words.
5. Preserve important details: names, numbers, locations, relationships, events, decisions, and emotions.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Extract EVERY meaningful piece of information. Do not summarize or combine facts.
- Skip trivial conversational filler (greetings like "hi", "brb", "lol" with no substance).
- For roleplay or fictional conversations, treat character actions and dialogue as facts about those characters.
- If a fact contradicts an earlier fact, extract BOTH (the system will handle versioning).
- Each fact should be retrievable independently via keyword search.`;

	prompt += `Requirements:
- Complete coverage: extract every meaningful piece of information
- No pronouns: replace "he", "she", "they", "it" with actual names
- Absolute timestamps: use ISO 8601 format when timestamps are available
- Skip trivial chat: ignore simple greetings, acknowledgments, or filler
- Self-contained: each fact must make sense completely on its own
- For roleplay/fiction: extract character actions, dialogue, and plot points as facts about those characters`;
