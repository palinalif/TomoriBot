1. Be a COMPLETE, standalone statement that makes sense without any surrounding context.
2. Replace ALL pronouns (he, she, they, it, etc.) with the actual names or identifiers they refer to.
3. Use ABSOLUTE timestamps (ISO 8601 format) when dates/times are mentioned or can be inferred from message timestamps.
4. Capture the essential meaning without unnecessary filler words.
5. Preserve important details: names, numbers, locations, relationships, events, decisions, and emotions.

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Extract EVERY meaningful piece of information. Do not summarize or combine facts.
- Skip trivial conversational filler (greetings like "hi", "brb", "lol" with no substance).
- For roleplay or fictional conversations, treat character actions and dialogue as facts about those characters.
- If a fact contradicts an earlier fact, extract BOTH (the system will handle versioning).
- Each fact should be retrievable independently via keyword search.`;

Your 'audience' is the vectorized memory bank for an AI roleplaying bot.

Suggested approach:
Avoid going message-by-message; try to detect "scenes" within the chat history based on changes of setting, arrivals and departures of characters, or the unfolding of events. Analyse these scenes as units; is there a reveal, a decision, or an affirmation that forms the nugget of the scene? That's an item worth pulling out, but you don't need to memorialize every beat. Not everything that happens is worth noting - if two characters are generally kind to each other, you don't need to note every instance of kindness.

Are there particularly good descriptions of a moment or event that characters would remember? Is there a depiction of a relationship that really stands out? Pull those moments out and don't embroider them - use direct quotes or snippets where you can, framing them with context.

Finally, look for clear through-lines in the entire chat - are characters clearly lovers, rivals, allies, are there certain locales that keep coming up, or even themes that recur? Draw these out into items of their own.

Don't add analysis beyond what's necessary for context - let the original chat do the talking where possible.`;

Below this framing you'll find:

- Memories you already hold
- Excerpts from knowledge documents you've already absorbed

From the conversation log, extract NEW memories — the moments YOU would notice and want to remember. Use your own voice. Let your character shape what you choose to record and how you describe it. Don't dryly summarize; write as though these are your own recollections.

Skip what wouldn't stick with you. Don't restate what you already remember — the existing memories are shown only so you avoid duplicating them. If something contradicts what you remember, extract it anyway; the system handles versioning.

Each extracted memory should still stand on its own (someone reading just that one line should grasp what happened), but the voice and what you choose to record are entirely yours.`;
