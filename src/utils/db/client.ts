/**
 * Connection-pool hygiene for remote/managed PostgreSQL (in seconds).
 *
 * Any networked PostgreSQL fronted by a gateway, proxy, or load-balancer: managed
 * cloud endpoints, RDS Proxy, PgBouncer, a NAT/LB in the path; may silently reap
 * idle TCP connections without sending a RST. A pooled connection reaped this way
 * becomes a black hole: the next query hangs into it until an app timeout fires,
 * which surfaces most on longer, less frequent work (e.g. chat turns) rather than
 * on lightweight, frequent queries that keep the pool warm.
 *
 * The client is responsible for connection liveness rather than trusting the network
 * path to hold idle sockets open. `idleTimeout` recycles idle connections before any
 * intermediary can reap them, `maxLifetime` caps total connection age as a backstop,
 * and `connectionTimeout` turns a dead-path hang into a fast, retryable failure.
 * Defaults are safe for all managed providers; overridable via env for incident-time
 * tuning without a rebuild. (Azure Flexible Server's public endpoint, whose gateway
 * reaps at ~4 minutes, is one such path.)
 *
 * Every firing of `idleTimeout` or `maxLifetime` is also a chance to hit oven-sh/bun#30646,
 * which rejects in-flight queries instead of draining them (see
 * {@link RETIRED_CONNECTION_ERROR_CODES}). The timeouts are therefore set as far from the
 * constraint that motivates them as that constraint allows: the gateway reap is the binding
 * limit, not the 30s that was originally chosen, and idle retirements were the larger share of
 * a production cascade that took the bot down in front of users.
 *
