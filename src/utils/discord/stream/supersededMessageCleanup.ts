/**
 * Deletes the Discord messages a superseded generation attempt already committed to the channel.
 *
 * When a primary model stalls and its `streamToDiscord` call is aborted by the SDK-call-timeout
 * watchdog, any segments it had already flushed remain in the channel as real messages. If a
 * fallback model then produces its own complete response, the channel would show two conflicting
 * messages. This helper removes the superseded attempt's partial output so only the surviving
 * response is left visible.
 *
 * Deletion is best-effort: a failure to delete one message (already gone, missing permissions,
 * expired webhook token) is logged and skipped rather than aborting the turn.
 *
 * @param refs - Messages delivered by the superseded attempt (order preserved).
 * @param options.channel - The channel the turn is streaming into; used for bot-native deletes,
 *   for the webhook-delete fallback, and to resolve the thread ID webhook deletion needs in threads.
 *   for webhook-delivered messages because it needs no Manage Messages permission.
