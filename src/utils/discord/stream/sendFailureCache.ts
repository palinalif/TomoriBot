/**
 * Negative cache for channels whose last message send was rejected for a reason that cannot
 * resolve on its own.
 *
 * The chat pipeline already gates on `SendMessages` before generating, but that check reads the
 * permission bitfield and Discord rejects sends for reasons the bitfield does not express. A
 * moderator timeout is the clearest example: the member keeps every permission, so the gate
 * passes, and every send still returns 50013. One production guild produced 397 such failures
 * across two days, each one a completed LLM call discarded at the last step.
 *
 * This is the backstop for that whole class: whatever the cause, once a send has actually been
 * refused, stop paying for responses to that channel until the situation might have changed.
 *
 * Distinct from the webhook failure cache in `webhookCore`, which suppresses the webhook lookup
 * rather than the send, and covers a different set of codes.
