/**
 * Cloud instance-metadata and link-local addresses that must NEVER be

 * These endpoints are the primary SSRF credential-theft target: the cloud
 * Instance Metadata Service (AWS/Azure/GCP all expose it at `169.254.169.254`)
 * hands out short-lived cloud credentials to anything that can reach it. There
 * is no legitimate `fetch_url`/custom-endpoint use case for them, so this
 * denylist is always enforced as a floor beneath every other network guard;
 * it cannot be relaxed by the development auto-relax or the operator opt-in.
 *
 * @param address - An already DNS-resolved IP address (IPv4 or IPv6 literal).
 *   Hostnames must be resolved by the caller first; this returns false for any
 *   non-IP input.
 * @returns True when the address is a cloud-metadata/link-local endpoint that
 *   must be blocked unconditionally.
