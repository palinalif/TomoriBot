- Server emojis (10 constant)

**Output tokens (AI response):**
- Response length varies by query complexity
- More detailed questions = longer responses = higher cost

**Tips to reduce costs:**
I have built-in features to help reduce costs from abusers or spammers in your server, but here are some additional tips:
- Use fewer persona paragraphs (attributes & dialogues)
- Keep memories concise
- Use free AI providers (Google Gemini free tier)
- Limit auto-trigger channels`,

I have built-in features to help reduce costs from abusers or spammers in your server, but here are some additional tips:
- Use fewer persona paragraphs (attributes & dialogues)
- Keep memories concise
- Use free AI providers (Google Gemini free tier)
- Limit auto-trigger channels`,

- Write natural, conversational exchanges
- Include personality traits you want me to exhibit
- Demonstrate the tone you want
- Add variety to help me learn better
- Use placeholders so dialogues work for everyone when sharing me with \`/persona export\``,

**Server-wide settings and behavior:**
Learning & Privacy:
- {serverMemberpermissions} - Control who can teach me things
- {serverBlacklist} - Prevent me from learning and using memories from specific users

Auto-Trigger Behavior:
- {serverAutotriggerChannels} - Set channels where I respond without mentions
- {serverAutotriggerThreshold} - Set message threshold for auto-responses

Triggers & Appearance:
- {serverTriggerAdd} - Add custom trigger words I respond to (also works with alter personas)
- {serverTriggerDelete} - Remove trigger words
- {serverAvatar} - Set my custom profile picture for this server

Channel Whitelist & Cooldowns:
- {configCooldown} - Set global cooldown between my responses
- {serverWhitelistChannel} - Add a channel to the whitelist (only whitelisted channels can trigger me)
- {serverWhitelistRole} - Add/remove roles allowed to trigger me when role whitelist is active
- {serverWhitelistRemove} - Remove a channel from the whitelist
- Whitelisted channels inherit the global cooldown unless you set a channel-specific override

Documents:
- {memoryDocumentAdd} - Upload a document for me to reference
- {memoryDocumentRemove} - Remove an uploaded document`,

        embed5_description: `- Start with a persona (default or generated) as a foundation
- Use \`/persona attribute add\` for quick personality tweaks
- For Sample Dialogues, using examples that exhibit their attributes and traits as well is effective:
\`\`\`
User message: {user}: What's your favorite hobby?
Bot response: {bot}: Fufu~ I like knitting tiny clothes for tiny plushies~♥
\`\`\`
- Test changes by chatting, iterate until it feels right
- Export your persona to back it up or share with other servers!`,

2. Paste this room's Internal Room ID from {room_id_path}.

Important:
- This room must stay unencrypted.
- Once linked, you can talk here normally.
- The only Matrix text commands are {kill_command} and {refresh_command}.

Use {help_command} in Discord for the full guide and limitation list.`,

Quick tips:
- Chat here normally to talk to TomoriBot.
- The only Matrix text commands are {kill_command} and {refresh_command}.
- Slash commands, DMs, and pinning are not available from Matrix.
- Custom emojis/Markdown do not render reliably, and embeds relay as plain text.
- Personal memories for Matrix users fall back to server memories.

Use {help_command} in Discord for the full guide and current limitations.`,
