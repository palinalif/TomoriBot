**Output tokens (AI response):**
- Response length varies by query complexity
- More detailed questions = longer responses = higher cost

**Tips to reduce costs:**
I have built-in features to help reduce costs from abusers or spammers in your server, but here are some additional tips:
- Use fewer persona paragraphs (attributes & dialogues)
- Keep memories concise
- Use free AI providers (Google Gemini free tier)
- Limit auto-trigger channels`,

- Imported does not always mean sent: nodes disabled in \`prompt_order\` stay off until you enable them with {stPresetToggle}
- Comment-only nodes and nodes that become empty after \`{{trim}}\` are never sent
- If enabled nodes still contain unsupported preset macros after import, the import summary warns you; those tags may still be sent literally or behave differently here
- Unknown markers are skipped
- Order is literal: if you place \`chatHistory\` before \`dialogueExamples\`, live chat comes first
- I use the \`prompt_order\` in the .json with \`character_id: 100001\`, and falls back to \`100000\` only if \`100001\` is missing
- If sample chats end up last, the bot adds a short separator so strict providers do not continue the example`,

        embed3_title: `Limits And Compatibility (Page 2)`,
        embed3_description: `- Post-history / depth injections are merged into existing chat history entries, not inserted as standalone messages
- Multiple nodes at the same depth are batched together
- \`{{setvar}}\` and \`{{addvar}}\` work across enabled nodes in node order, but variables are global for the whole preset
- Most native blocks are moved, not removed: \`main\`, \`charDescription\`, \`charPersonality\`, \`dialogueExamples\`, \`chatHistory\`, and \`worldInfo\` markers reposition my own system prompt, persona prompt, persona attributes, sample chats, live history, and retrieved docs
- The real suppressions are narrow: the built-in fallback system prompt is removed only if you did not set {configSystemPromptSet}, and native \`charDescription\` / \`charPersonality\` are skipped only when a custom node already expands \`{{description}}\` / \`{{personality}}\`
- Tomori-only automatic blocks are not owned by ST markers: server info, memories, emoji/sticker context flush after \`main\` / \`charDescription\` / \`charPersonality\`; users-in-conversation, STM, conditioning, and leftover RAG flush before \`dialogueExamples\` / \`chatHistory\`
- User impersonation via {botImpersonate} ignores the preset and uses the normal layout
- Older text-completions presets that use \`context.story_string\` + \`sysprompt.content\` are imported through a best-effort conversion path
- That legacy conversion maps the main system prompt, story layout, and post-history, but ST-only blocks like \`persona\`, \`scenario\`, anchors, stop strings, and old backend settings are still ignored
- Some extra legacy \`post_history\` fields on modern Prompt Manager presets are imported too
- Regex post-processing, preset-side temperature/top_p/model overrides, and layered presets are not supported
- \`worldInfo\` markers use retrieved document context instead of ST lorebooks
- Some automatic server/context blocks may still be inserted even if your preset does not place explicit ST markers for them
- Provider-specific behavior still applies: assistant prefill may work on some providers and be ignored on others`,

**Personality Shaping:**
- {personaAttributeAdd} - Add personality traits or physical characteristics (e.g., "friendly", "red hair", "ends sentences with *Nya~*")
- {personaSampleDialogueAdd} - Add example conversations to shape how I talk
- {configRename} - Set what I should call myself

**Writing Sample Dialogues:**
Use \`{user}\` and \`{bot}\` placeholders in your examples:
- \`{user}\` = Replaced with the actual user's name/nickname
- \`{bot}\` = Replaced with my current name

**Example:**
\`\`\`
{user}: Hey, how are you?
{bot}: Yoooo {user}! I'm doin' great, ya feel me?
\`\`\`

**Tips for Great Sample Dialogues:**
- Write natural, conversational exchanges
- Include personality traits you want me to exhibit
- Demonstrate the tone you want
- Add variety to help me learn better
- Use placeholders so dialogues work for everyone when sharing me with \`/persona export\``,

**Using Smithery.ai:**
**1.** Visit [smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai), create an account, and generate an API key from your profile.
**2.** Browse the catalog and open an MCP you want. Copy the **connection URL** shown on its page (e.g. \`https://youtube.run.tools\`).
**3.** Run {configMcpAdd}. Paste the connection URL into the **URL** field. In the **Auth Token** field, paste your Smithery API key.

**Using other sources:**
If an MCP server requires no authentication, leave the **Auth Token** field blank. Some servers may use a different auth format — check the server's documentation for details.

Your auth token is encrypted at rest and never shown in plain text after saving.`,

- Return **harmful or false results** that TomoriBot will relay to your server

Treat MCP servers with the same caution as browser extensions or third-party apps. If in doubt, do not add it.`,

Important:
- This room must stay unencrypted.
- Once linked, you can talk here normally.
- The only Matrix text commands are {kill_command} and {refresh_command}.

Use {help_command} in Discord for the full guide and limitation list.`,

Quick tips:
- Chat here normally to talk to TomoriBot.
- The only Matrix text commands are {kill_command} and {refresh_command}.
- Slash commands, DMs, and pinning are not available from Matrix.
- Custom emojis/Markdown do not render reliably, and embeds relay as plain text.
- Personal memories for Matrix users fall back to server memories.
