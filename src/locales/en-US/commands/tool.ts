- Server & personal memories
- Enabled tools (if any)
- User statuses & reminders
- Recent conversation history (includes images, videos, stickers, emojis, embeds if provider supports)
- Server emojis (10 constant)

**Output tokens (AI response):**
- Response length varies by query complexity
- More detailed questions = longer responses = higher cost

**Tips to reduce costs:**
I have built-in features to help reduce costs from abusers or spammers in your server, but here are some additional tips:
- Use fewer persona paragraphs (attributes & dialogues)
- Keep memories concise
- Use free AI providers (Google Gemini free tier)
- Limit auto-trigger channels`,
