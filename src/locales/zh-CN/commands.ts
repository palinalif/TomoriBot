// Assembler: edit the individual files in commands/ instead.
//
// Only the command slices translated so far are imported here. Add each remaining
// `./commands/<name>` import and its spread alongside its translation: an import of a file
// that does not exist yet fails TypeScript resolution for the whole project, and the other
// locale slices already cover `commands/` in the meantime.
