/**
 * Refresh Message Timestamps Tool
 *
 * Triggers a context restart that rebuilds the conversation history with
 * timestamp annotations appended to every message, showing both an absolute
 * UTC time and a relative "X ago" label.
 *
 * This is an on-demand tool — timestamps are not included in context by default
 * to avoid token bloat. The LLM calls this when precise timing information is
 * needed (e.g. "when did Toasty send that message?").
 *
 * Like the media context tools, this tool does not perform the rebuild itself.
 * It returns a `context_restart_with_timestamps` signal that tomoriChat.ts
 * intercepts, then calls buildContext() again with `includeTimestamps: true`.
