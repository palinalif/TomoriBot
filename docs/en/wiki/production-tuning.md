Detailed operational rationale, container sizing, and incident tuning for Tier 8 configuration
variables. These settings govern dedicated 24/7 production hosts, virtual private servers (VPS),
and cloud provider environments (such as Azure VM and AWS EC2).

## Container Sizing and Swap Dynamics

Production Compose files (such as `deploy/azure/docker-compose.yml`) apply strict cgroup resource
constraints to prevent out-of-memory kernel kills.

### Memory and Swap Bounds

- `TOMORIBOT_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`: Hard memory limit assigned to the bot container cgroup.
- `TOMORIBOT_MEMORY_SWAP_LIMIT_MB`: Combined memory plus swap ceiling.

If swap limit is omitted, Docker assigns double the memory limit by default. On a host backed by
compressed swap devices (e.g. zram) or swapfiles, an unrestricted allowance can saturate system swap
and prevent the cgroup from swapping further. Size `TOMORIBOT_MEMORY_SWAP_LIMIT_MB` above the host
swap device capacity so unevicted memory overflows safely to disk.

### SearXNG Python Worker Footprint

`SEARXNG_BLOCKING_THREADS` controls concurrent upstream engine queries in the SearXNG sidecar.

SearXNG uses a Python worker architecture where deallocated objects return to internal arenas
instead of the host operating system. Peak concurrency establishes a resident memory floor that
persists for the entire life of the container. On swap-backed hosts, this memory stays occupied in
swap. Furthermore, RSS-based respawn guards fail to detect this degradation because swapped-out
workers report an artificially low RSS. Keeping `SEARXNG_BLOCKING_THREADS=1` caps worker resident
memory on constrained hosts.

## In-Process Memory Guard

The bot runs an internal memory monitor to safeguard against memory exhaustion before the container
cgroup kills the process.

- `CONTAINER_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`: The explicit memory ceiling against which internal warning and
  critical percentage thresholds are calculated. On Azure, this is injected from
  `TOMORIBOT_MEMORY_LIMIT_MB`. In custom deployments, set this manually to match the container
  allocation.
- `MEMORY_WARNING_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.75): Triggers proactive memory logging.
- `MEMORY_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD` (default: 0.85): Enters emergency cooling mode, suspending heavy
  media tasks and initiating cache purging.
- `EMERGENCY_CACHE_CLEAR_INCLUDE_STM` (default: false): Short-term memory (STM) is preserved
  during emergency clearing to avoid user-visible conversation amnesia. Enable only if heap
  exhaustion persists despite volatile Discord cache eviction.
- `EMERGENCY_CACHE_CLEAR_DISCORD_VOLATILE` (default: true): Evicts ephemeral Discord.js client
  caches (messages, user references, presence, and voice states).

## Native Image Processing (libvips / sharp)

Image manipulation uses libvips via the `sharp` library.

- `SHARP_CONCURRENCY`: Number of concurrent image processing pipelines.
- `SHARP_CACHE_MEMORY_MB`, `SHARP_CACHE_ITEMS`, `SHARP_CACHE_FILES`: Operation and descriptor cache caps.

Libvips allocates native memory outside the V8/Bun JavaScript heap. This memory does not appear in
JavaScript heap counters but directly consumes container cgroup memory. Each concurrent pipeline
holds fully uncompressed bitmap buffers. On memory-constrained hosts (e.g. 512 MB to 1 GB RAM), keep
`SHARP_CONCURRENCY=1` to prevent sudden native memory spikes.

## Managed PostgreSQL Connection Pooling

Production database connections require lifecycle management to withstand cloud network gateways
and runtime quirks.

### Silent Gateway TCP Reaping

Managed database services (such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server on public endpoints)
silently terminate idle TCP connections at their network gateway after roughly 4 minutes without
emitting a TCP RST packet.

If a connection in the application pool is reaped silently, the next query dispatched to that socket
hangs until the application query timeout elapses (often 3 minutes), stalling user turns. Setting
`POSTGRES_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=180` forces the application pool to retire and recycle connections
safely below the 240-second gateway threshold.

### Pool Retiral Handling and Jitter

Bun's database client can retire timed-out connections without draining active in-flight queries
(`oven-sh/bun#30646`). To handle these transient disconnections gracefully:

- `POSTGRES_TRANSIENT_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3`: Queries wrapped in `withTransientDbRetry` are re-issued. A
  single retry was found insufficient in production because connection closures often occur in
  cascading cohorts, causing a second attempt to strike the same retirement wave. Three attempts
  provide reliable recovery.
- `POSTGRES_TRANSIENT_RETRY_DELAY_MS=100`: When a pooled cohort expires simultaneously, multiple
  in-flight requests fail within the same millisecond. A randomized jitter delay (uniform between
  0 and 100 ms) prevents a thundering herd on the newly created replacement sockets.
- `POOL_EVENT_EPISODE_QUIET_MS=60000`: Consolidates consecutive socket retiral events into a
  single incident log entry to prevent log spam.

## Host Pressure Detector (PSI and Swap-In)

The host pressure detector continuously monitors Linux Pressure Stall Information (PSI) and
swap activity to identify host-level memory and I/O starvation.

### Analytical Model and Calibration

The default thresholds were calibrated by replaying 67,967 production telemetry samples through
the replay harness (`bun run scripts/devtools/replayPressureDetector.ts <observer.log> --verbose`):

- `PRESSURE_ELEVATED_IO_FULL=15`: PSI `io full avg60` indicating moderate contention.
- `PRESSURE_CRITICAL_IO_FULL=30`: Severe contention indicating degraded host performance.
- `PRESSURE_RECOVERY_IO_FULL=5`: Lower recovery threshold creating hysteresis so boundary
  fluctuations do not flip states back and forth.
- `PRESSURE_MIN_SWAP_IN_PER_S=1`: Distinguishes active thrashing from inert swap. High total swap
  allocation with zero swap-in represents cold pages evicted long ago, which is harmless. Active
  swap-in confirms the kernel is thrashing.

### Duty Cycle Measurement

Host pressure spikes constantly cross threshold lines but rarely remain above them continuously
without brief drops. A strict continuous duration rule fails to trigger during chronic host
degradation. Instead, `PRESSURE_MIN_DUTY_CYCLE=0.95` requires the pressure condition to hold for
95% of the sliding window (`PRESSURE_ELEVATED_DWELL_MS=3600000` for 1 hour, or
`PRESSURE_CRITICAL_DWELL_MS=1800000` for 30 minutes).

`PRESSURE_STARTUP_GRACE_MS=900000` suppresses alerts during the initial 15-minute warmup phase.
`PRESSURE_DETECTOR_ARMED=false` keeps the detector in advisory monitoring mode; automated recycling
is reserved for an external host watchdog.

## Observability Sinks and Log Management

### Error Log Database Circuit Breaker

When the PostgreSQL instance itself experiences an outage or connectivity failure, every concurrent
request handler emits an error. Attempting to write each failure into the `error_logs` table creates
an insert cascade that exhausts the failing pool further.

`ERROR_DB_LOGGING_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5` trips the circuit breaker after 5 consecutive database logging
failures. The breaker remains open for `ERROR_DB_LOGGING_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS=60000` (1 minute),
routing errors exclusively to stdout and the local JSON file.

### Write-Path Retention Pruning

Production deployments avoid `pg_cron` dependencies. Table maintenance (`METRIC_SAMPLE_PRUNE_INTERVAL_MS`
and `ERROR_LOG_PRUNE_INTERVAL_MS`) piggybacks onto normal metric and error write paths, throttled to
run at most once every 6 hours.

### On-Demand Heap Profiling

Setting `HEAP_SNAPSHOT_DIR` registers a `SIGUSR2` signal handler that triggers a Chrome DevTools
`.heapsnapshot` dump. This allows diagnosing unmanaged array buffer or external memory growth that
normal counters cannot attribute.

**Operational trade-off**: Serializing the snapshot string requires approximately half the live heap
in additional temporary memory. On a memory-constrained host, initiating a snapshot is itself a
heavy pressure event. Collect snapshots during moderate uptime, and restart the container
afterward. Ensure the target directory points to a writable host bind mount, as production containers
run with a read-only root filesystem.

### Streaming JSON Logs

- `TOMORI_LOG_FILE`: Mirrors log records with level >= 50 (error, metric, rateLimit, fatal) to an
  append-only JSONL file for consumption by host agents (e.g. Azure Monitor Agent).
- `LOG_MAX_STRING_LENGTH` (default: unset): Optional cap for oversized string fields. Unset by
  default so prompts, memories, and stack traces remain complete. Base64 data URIs are collapsed
  directly in log redaction regardless of this setting.
