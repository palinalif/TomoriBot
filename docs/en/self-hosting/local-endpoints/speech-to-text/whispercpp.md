whisper.cpp can be used when its HTTP server exposes an OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint.

## Setup

Start your whisper.cpp HTTP server and confirm it exposes an OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint:

- `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`
- `GET /v1/models` or `GET /models`

Keep the server running while TomoriBot is using it. The endpoint URL is the server root, such as `http://127.0.0.1:8022`.

If your whisper.cpp build exposes a different endpoint shape, place a thin wrapper in front of it that maps requests to TomoriBot's expected OpenAI-compatible shape.

## Register in TomoriBot

Run `/providers`, choose **Add New Custom Endpoint**, and use the transcription API compatibility:

- API Compatibility: `openai-compatible-transcription`
- `endpoint_url`: your whisper.cpp server root

After saving the connection, select it and use its model dropdown to add the model name your
server reports as a Transcription model.

Use `/providers` for endpoint registration and model setup. Then open `/config` > Models > Switch Models to select and activate the registered endpoint.

## Use Transcripts

After registration, TomoriBot transcribes audio attachments in the background and adds the text to chat context. Use `/config` > Engine > Notices only if you also want transcripts posted visibly in chat.
