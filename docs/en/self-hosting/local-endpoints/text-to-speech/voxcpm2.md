VoxCPM2 is OpenBMB's 2B-parameter multilingual text-to-speech model. It supports 30 languages, 48 kHz output, natural-language Voice Design, reference-audio voice cloning, controllable cloning, and transcript-assisted "Ultimate Cloning". TomoriBot uses the official `voxcpm` Python package through the thin wrapper in `servers/tts/voxcpm2/`.

The default model is the official `openbmb/VoxCPM2` BF16 checkpoint. OpenBMB reports roughly **8 GB VRAM** for the standard runtime, so the normal model comfortably fits a 16 GB NVIDIA GPU and no quantized checkpoint is needed by default.

## License

VoxCPM2 code and model weights are released under **Apache-2.0**, including commercial use subject to the license terms. TomoriBot does not redistribute the weights; the installer downloads them from the official Hugging Face repository.

## Supported languages

VoxCPM2 officially supports 30 languages without requiring a language tag:

Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Malay, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, and Vietnamese.

OpenBMB also documents several Chinese dialects. TomoriBot may still send a `language` field for compatibility with the common TTS contract, but VoxCPM2 detects the language from the synthesis text and the wrapper does not force a language tag.

## Voice modes

One VoxCPM2 endpoint can handle all useful TomoriBot voice-source modes:

| TomoriBot request | VoxCPM2 behavior |
|---|---|
| `text` only | Rejected; choose a reference sample or VoiceDesign prompt |
| `text` + `instruct` | Voice Design from a natural-language description |
| `text` + `ref_audio` | Reference-audio voice cloning |
| `text` + `ref_audio` + `instruct` | Controllable cloning: preserve the speaker while steering delivery |
| `text` + `ref_audio` + `ref_text` | Ultimate Cloning using the reference audio and its transcript |
| `text` + `ref_audio` + `ref_text` + `instruct` | Controllable cloning; the one-off instruction takes precedence and the transcript is not sent |

VoxCPM2 represents Voice Design and style control by placing a natural-language description in parentheses before the text to synthesize. TomoriBot already has an `instruct` field for this purpose, so the wrapper performs that conversion automatically.

Use **Plain** Script Markup. VoxCPM2 does not require TomoriBot to preserve bracket tags or emoji control syntax, and no new Script Markup mode is necessary.

## Hardware and runtime

Recommended starting point:

- Python **3.10-3.12**
- NVIDIA GPU with **8 GB VRAM or more** for the official BF16 runtime; 12-16 GB gives comfortable headroom
- Current NVIDIA driver and a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build for GPU acceleration
- CPU is supported as a fallback but is substantially slower

The official package also exposes CPU and Apple MPS device selection. For TomoriBot on Windows, the standard Python package can run natively; WSL is not required. The Windows PowerShell installer installs a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build (`cu124`) by default.

To explicitly install on a CPU-only machine, pass the `-Cpu` switch:

```powershell
.\servers\tts\voxcpm2\install-voxcpm2.ps1 -Cpu
```

If your native Windows PyTorch installation ever needs a manual reinstall or driver realignment, install the CUDA-enabled PyTorch build directly into the sidecar's virtual environment:

```powershell
.\servers\tts\voxcpm2\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe install --force-reinstall torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

OpenBMB reports about 0.30 RTF on an RTX 4090 with the standard runtime. Upstream also supports streaming generation and documents faster Nano-vLLM and vLLM-Omni serving options. TomoriBot's current `POST /synthesize` contract returns one WAV response, so this sidecar intentionally buffers the generated utterance instead of exposing a separate streaming protocol.

## Installation

The sidecar pins the current stable `voxcpm` 2.0.3 package and downloads `openbmb/VoxCPM2` into the normal Hugging Face cache.

### Linux / WSL Bash

From the TomoriBot repository root:

```bash
bash servers/tts/voxcpm2/install-voxcpm2.sh
servers/tts/voxcpm2/.venv/bin/python servers/tts/voxcpm2/server.py
```

### Windows PowerShell

From the TomoriBot repository root:

```powershell
.\servers\tts\voxcpm2\install-voxcpm2.ps1
.\servers\tts\voxcpm2\.venv\Scripts\python.exe servers\tts\voxcpm2\server.py
```

The first setup downloads several gigabytes of model weights. To install the Python environment without prefetching the model, set `VOXCPM2_PREFETCH=0`; the official library will then download the checkpoint on first server start.

Linux / WSL:

```bash
VOXCPM2_PREFETCH=0 bash servers/tts/voxcpm2/install-voxcpm2.sh
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:VOXCPM2_PREFETCH = "0"
.\servers\tts\voxcpm2\install-voxcpm2.ps1
```

After setup, `bun run launch --voxcpm2` starts the sidecar together with TomoriBot. The default endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8016`.

If `VOXCPM2_API_KEY` or `TOMORI_TTS_API_KEY` is set, register the endpoint with authentication enabled and save the same key in TomoriBot. The launcher still probes the unauthenticated `/health` route, while synthesis requests use `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

## Register in TomoriBot

Run `/providers`, choose **Add New Custom Endpoint**, and configure the Speech endpoint:

- Capability: `Speech`
- API Compatibility: `tts-clone`
- Endpoint URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8016`
- Voice Source Mode: `Auto`
- Script Markup: `Plain`
- Supports Instruct: `Yes`

After saving the connection, select it and use its model dropdown to add a Speech model. Then open `/config` > Models > Switch Models and select the VoxCPM2 speech model.

`Auto` is recommended because the same server supports reference-audio cloning and Voice Design. You do not need separate VoxCPM2 processes for the two modes.

## Persona voice cloning

For a persona that should clone an existing speaker:

1. Prepare a clean reference clip with one speaker and little or no background music. Upstream treats 5 to 30 seconds as the practical range.
2. Open `/config` under Models > TTS Parameters & Voices and upload the clip.
3. Add the exact transcript of the reference clip when available. VoxCPM2 uses it for Ultimate Cloning and can reproduce more of the reference rhythm, emotion, and style.
4. Open `/config` under Persona > Voice, choose the persona, and assign the saved sample.

If no transcript is stored, VoxCPM2 still performs normal reference-audio cloning.

The 5 to 30 second figure is a documented quality range rather than an enforced cap: VoxCPM2 applies no reference-duration limit of its own, so TomoriBot's upload ceiling is what stops a longer clip.

## Persona Voice Design

For a persona that should be created from a written voice description instead of a sample:

1. Open `/config` under Persona > Voice and choose VoiceDesign.
2. Choose the persona.
3. Enter a natural-language description such as `Young adult woman, soft warm voice, relaxed pace, slightly playful delivery`.

TomoriBot sends the saved description as `instruct`. VoxCPM2 converts it into its native Voice Design control prefix.

When a cloned persona also receives one-off voice instructions, VoxCPM2 uses controllable cloning: the reference sample supplies the speaker identity while the instruction steers qualities such as emotion, pace, or delivery. If a transcript is also stored, the instruction takes precedence because the upstream Ultimate Cloning path does not provide a reliable control-instruction mode; the transcript is intentionally omitted for that request.

## `/generate voice-message`

Once VoxCPM2 is the active Speech model, `/generate voice-message` uses the persona's configured voice source in the same way as normal voice-message tool calls:

- clone personas send the stored `ref_audio` and optional `ref_text`;
- VoiceDesign personas send their saved prompt as `instruct`;
- clone-capable endpoints with Supports Instruct enabled expose the Delivery Direction field and pass one-off instructions through `instruct`;
- when an instruction is present with a clone sample, TomoriBot uses `reference_wav_path` only and does not send the transcript prompt fields.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `VOXCPM2_MODEL_ID` | `openbmb/VoxCPM2` | Hugging Face model ID or local model directory |
| `VOXCPM2_DEVICE` | `auto` | Runtime device: `auto`, `cuda`, `cuda:N`, `cpu`, or `mps` |
| `VOXCPM2_OPTIMIZE` | `1` | Enable the official runtime's optimization / compile path |
| `VOXCPM2_LOAD_DENOISER` | `0` | Load the optional upstream denoiser; disabled by default to save memory |
| `VOXCPM2_CFG_VALUE` | `2.0` | Guidance strength |
| `VOXCPM2_INFERENCE_TIMESTEPS` | `10` | Flow-matching inference steps; more can improve quality at the cost of speed |
| `VOXCPM2_MAX_LEN` | `4096` | Maximum generation length |
| `VOXCPM2_NORMALIZE` | `0` | Enable upstream text normalization |
| `VOXCPM2_RETRY_BADCASE` | `1` | Enable upstream retry behavior for abnormal generations |
| `VOXCPM2_RETRY_BADCASE_MAX_TIMES` | `3` | Maximum automatic retries |
| `VOXCPM2_RETRY_BADCASE_RATIO_THRESHOLD` | `6.0` | Upstream bad-case length threshold |
| `VOXCPM2_PREFETCH` | `1` | Installer only: download the model during setup |
| `VOXCPM2_PORT` | `8016` | VoxCPM2 sidecar port; falls back to `TOMORI_TTS_PORT` when unset |
| `TOMORI_TTS_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Sidecar bind address |
| `TOMORI_TTS_PORT` | `8016` | Backward-compatible shared sidecar port fallback |
| `VOXCPM2_MAX_REF_AUDIO_BYTES` | `10485760` | Maximum decoded reference-audio size |
| `VOXCPM2_API_KEY` | unset | Optional bearer token for `/synthesize`; `TOMORI_TTS_API_KEY` is accepted as a fallback |
| `TOMORI_TTS_API_KEY` | unset | Shared optional bearer token fallback for `/synthesize` |
| `TOMORI_TTS_ALLOW_REMOTE_BIND` | `0` | Set to `1` only to allow a non-loopback bind without a bearer token |
| `TOMORI_TTS_MAX_TEXT_CHARS` | `2000` | Maximum accepted synthesis text length |

Reference audio must be a non-empty WAV container. The wrapper enforces the decoded byte limit before writing a temporary file. `/health` remains unauthenticated for local readiness checks; `/synthesize` requires `Authorization: Bearer <key>` whenever a key is configured. Keep the default loopback bind unless a reverse proxy or explicit remote policy is in place.

## Alternate checkpoints and runtimes

The official BF16 model already fits the intended 16 GB consumer-GPU target, so TomoriBot does not default to a quantized checkpoint. Community quantizations exist, but they add another compatibility and maintenance layer without being necessary for the normal setup.

For high-throughput deployments, OpenBMB currently points to Nano-vLLM-VoxCPM and vLLM-Omni as accelerated serving options. Those runtimes can expose streaming and concurrent-serving features beyond this reference sidecar. They are not required for TomoriBot's normal local voice-message workflow, and this wrapper deliberately stays on the official `voxcpm` API so upstream model upgrades remain easy to follow.
