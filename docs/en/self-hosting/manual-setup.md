:::note
Users who want to use Docker Compose should skip this wizard, see
[Docker Compose](/self-hosting/docker-compose/) for the containerized install path.
:::

This is the manual install procedure for technical users who'd rather not use the guided
wizard. If you want the hand-held path, use the [setup wizard](/self-hosting/setup-wizard/) instead as it
creates `.env`, generates a safe `CRYPTO_SECRET`, configures PostgreSQL, and runs the install
for you.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Node.js v20+ (used for MCP tooling)
- PostgreSQL installed natively, or run in a Docker container (see step 2)

PostgreSQL schema, `pgcrypto`, seeds, and migrations initialize automatically on bot startup.

## 1. Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bredrumb/TomoriBot.git
cd TomoriBot
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

## 2. Configure

Create your environment file from the example and fill in the required values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Required:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: your Discord bot token (enable the `GuildMembers`, `MessageContent`, and
  `GuildPresences` privileged intents).
- `CRYPTO_SECRET`: a 32-character encryption key (used to encrypt stored API keys).
- PostgreSQL connection: `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`,
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`.

:::note[No native PostgreSQL?]
Run just the database in a container, then point the `POSTGRES_*` values at it:

```sh
docker run -d --name tomori-db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=tomori -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=tomori \
  -p 5432:5432 pgvector/pgvector:pg16
```

Then set `POSTGRES_HOST=localhost`, `POSTGRES_PORT=5432`, and the user/password/db above.
The `pgvector/pgvector` image ships the RAG extension pre-installed; swap it for `postgres:16`
if you don't need document/RAG memory. This runs only the database in Docker and the bot
still runs on host Bun. For a fully containerized bot and database, use
[Docker Compose](/self-hosting/docker-compose/) instead.
:::

Optional tuning lives in `.env.optional.example`. Copy over any values you want to
customize (limits, timeouts, feature toggles, sidecar URLs, etc.).

## 3. Run

```sh
bun run dev
```

When you see `TomoriBot up and running!`, go to Discord and run `/setup` in your
server to connect an AI provider and initialize the bot. The command opens a guided
checklist panel, and nothing is written until you press **Finish Setup**; see
[The `/setup` command](/self-hosting/setup-wizard/#the-setup-command) for the steps and the
[Quickstart](/introduction/quickstart/) for the in-Discord side.

Use `bun run launch` instead of `bun run dev` if you want optional sidecars (SearXNG, Crawl4AI, local TTS/STT) launched alongside the bot:

```sh
bun run launch --searxng --crawl4ai
bun run launch --help        # see all flags
```

## Optional extras (the manual "Full Install")
<!-- anchor: optional-extras-the-manual-full-install -->

The [setup wizard](/self-hosting/setup-wizard/)'s **Full Install** path layers four lightweight extras on
top of the base install. None are required to run the bot, but each unlocks a feature. If
you're installing by hand, add whichever you want:

### `pgvector` : document/RAG memory

RAG (document uploads and cross-channel recall) stores embeddings in a `vector` column, which
needs the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension. Install it for your
PostgreSQL major version:

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu, e.g. for PostgreSQL 16
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16-pgvector
```

Then enable it once on your database. Connect with `psql` using the `POSTGRES_*` values from
your `.env`: it prompts for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`:

:::note[Windows]
There is no prebuilt pgvector package for native Windows PostgreSQL. Installing it means
building from source against your exact PostgreSQL version with Visual Studio C++ and `nmake`
(see pgvector's [Windows instructions](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector#windows)). The
simpler path on Windows is to run the database in the `pgvector/pgvector` container shown under
[Configure](#2-configure) above, which ships the extension pre-installed.
:::

```sh
# Native / host psql (substitute your own POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_DB):
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U tomori -d tomodb

# Or, if the database runs in the Docker container from step 2:
docker exec -it tomori-db psql -U tomori -d tomori
```

Once connected, run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION vector;
```

Without pgvector the bot still runs but RAG features become completely unavailable. This extension is
also required on the target database before restoring a backup; see
[Safe Migration](/self-hosting/safe-migration/) for details.

### `pg_cron` : scheduled cleanup jobs

`pg_cron` powers optional periodic database maintenance (cooldown/reminder-row cleanup).
Docker Compose from this repo already configures it.

:::caution[Not required for reminders or triggers]
`pg_cron` is **purely housekeeping** as it only cleans up stale rows. Reminder delivery and
random triggers run in the app itself, so those features work with or without `pg_cron`.
:::

For a self-managed PostgreSQL, find your active config file:

```sql
SHOW config_file;
```

Enable the extension in `postgresql.conf`: append to `shared_preload_libraries` if it
already lists other libraries:

```ini
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_cron'   # e.g. 'pg_stat_statements,pg_cron'
cron.database_name = 'your_dbname'
```

Restart PostgreSQL, then:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;
```

### Tokenizer assets : model-aware logit bias

Logit bias (emoji/word repetition penalties) needs local tokenizer assets:

```sh
bun run setup:tokenizers
```

Some families (e.g. Gemma) are gated and require a
[HuggingFace token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) after you accept their license:

```sh
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:HF_TOKEN="hf_xxx"; bun run setup:tokenizers

# macOS/Linux
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx bun run setup:tokenizers
```

Without this step logit bias is silently disabled and everything else works normally.

The secure `fetch_url` fallback runs in process and needs no Python package. DuckDuckGo/IAsk
`web_search` ships with `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, so it also needs no extra installation.

## Maintenance, updating & backups

Once you're installed, the host-side scripts (`bun run update`, `bun run backup`,
`bun run restore-backup`, `bun run nuke-db`, `bun run rotate-keys`, …) and the update and
backup procedures all live on the [Maintenance & Backups](/self-hosting/maintenance/) page. If you're about
to pull a new version, start with [Safe Migration](/self-hosting/safe-migration/).
