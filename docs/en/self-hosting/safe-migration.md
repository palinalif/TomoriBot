When you `git pull` new code and restart TomoriBot, the bot automatically runs database schema migrations on boot. This is powerful: it means you don't have to manually manage SQL updates, but it also means destructive operations can silently affect your data. This guide shows you how to protect yourself before pulling.

## Why this matters

TomoriBot's migration runner (in `src/db/migrationRunner.ts`) executes all unapplied migrations in version order. Migrations are **forward-only**: if something goes wrong, the runner does not auto-rollback. Most migrations are safe expansions (new columns, new tables), but per the project's internal design policy (OD-R-6), destructive operations such as `DROP COLUMN` or `DROP TABLE` are permitted. If a destructive migration runs without a backup, you lose data permanently. When in doubt, back up first.

## Pre-pull checklist

Follow these steps BEFORE running `git pull`:

1. **Stop the bot**: shut down the TomoriBot process so no active database connections interfere with the backup.
2. **Back up the database**: use one of the two methods below.
3. **Note the current commit**: run `git rev-parse HEAD` and save the output in case rollback is needed.
4. **Pull and restart**: once the backup is safely on disk, you're safe to pull and restart.

### Prerequisite: the `pgvector` extension

A full backup is a plain-SQL `pg_dump` (`backupData.ts` runs `pg_dump --clean --if-exists -f`), so it contains the `vector`-typed `document_chunks` table used for RAG. **The target Postgres must have the `pgvector` extension available before you restore**, or the dump's `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector` cannot run and the `document_chunks` table fails to create.

Install it once on the host (matching your Postgres major version), e.g. for Postgres 16:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-16-pgvector
```

Confirm it is available:

```bash
psql -c "SELECT name, default_version FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'vector';"
```

If you restore without it:

- The project's `restore-backup` (and any `psql -f` run with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1`) **aborts early** with `extension "vector" is not available`: no data is loaded. Install pgvector and retry.
- A manual `psql -f` run that **ignores errors** (`ON_ERROR_STOP=0`) is worse: the failed `COPY public.document_chunks` desynchronizes psql's input parser, which then mis-parses the following `COPY` data rows as SQL (a `syntax error at or near …` cascade). This silently drops whole tables (observed: `documents` and `llms`), leaving a partially-restored database that looks intact but has lost rows. Always restore with `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` so failures surface immediately.

### Option A: Use the project's backup script

TomoriBot includes two backup scripts, each targeting different data:

- **`bun run backup`**: Full database schema + data dump (personas, memories, configs, everything)
- **`bun run backup:personas`**: Persona presets and per-persona server memories only

For a safe migration, use the **full backup**:

```bash
bun run backup
```

This creates a timestamped bundle in `backups/` (or your `TOMORI_BACKUP_DIR` if overridden in `.env`) containing the entire PostgreSQL database as a plain SQL dump. To restore later, run:

```bash
bun run restore-backup --latest
```

Or restore from a specific bundle:

```bash
bun run restore-backup --from backups/backup_2024-01-15_14-30-45
```

### Automatic local startup backups

In non-production (`RUN_ENV` not set to `production`), TomoriBot also checks for a full data backup before database initialization runs. It creates an automatic `backupData.ts`-compatible bundle when either condition is true:

- the latest full data backup was created by a different `package.json` bot version
- the latest full data backup is at least `TOMORI_AUTO_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` old (default: `24`)

Automatic backups are tagged with `backupType: "automatic"` in `bundle_info.json` and named with an `_auto` suffix. Manual `bun run backup` bundles are tagged as `manual`; they can satisfy the latest-backup check, but they never count toward automatic retention. The startup gate keeps the newest `TOMORI_AUTO_BACKUP_MAX` automatic bundles (default: `5`) and deletes older automatic bundles only.

Set `TOMORI_AUTO_BACKUP_ENABLED=false` in `.env` if you need to start a local/dev bot without this safety gate, for example on a machine without `pg_dump`.

### Option B: Direct `pg_dump`

If you prefer manual control, use PostgreSQL's built-in `pg_dump` utility with TomoriBot's own environment variables:

```bash
pg_dump \
  -h "$POSTGRES_HOST" \
  -p "$POSTGRES_PORT" \
  -U "$POSTGRES_USER" \
  -d "$POSTGRES_DB" \
  -F c \
  -f "tomoribot-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).dump"
```

This saves a custom-format binary dump (more compact than SQL text). The environment variables match your `.env`:

- `POSTGRES_HOST`: default `localhost`
- `POSTGRES_PORT`: default `5432`
- `POSTGRES_USER`: your DB user
- `POSTGRES_DB`: default `tomodb`

To restore:

```bash
pg_restore \
  -h "$POSTGRES_HOST" \
  -p "$POSTGRES_PORT" \
  -U "$POSTGRES_USER" \
  -d "$POSTGRES_DB" \
  tomoribot-backup-20240115-143045.dump
```

**Note:** `pg_restore` will prompt for your password unless you set it in a `.pgpass` file (PostgreSQL's built-in credential file).

## For contributors deploying via CI: the `(Checkpoint)` convention

If you maintain a fork that deploys to AWS or GCP via the workflows in `.github/workflows/deploy-tomoribot-{aws,gcp}.yml`, those pipelines support an **opt-in pre-deploy snapshot**: when a commit message contains the literal token `(Checkpoint)`, the workflow runs `aws rds create-db-snapshot` (or the GCP Cloud SQL equivalent) **before** any code is deployed and before the migration runner touches the database on boot.

Use it when:

- You're shipping a migration that drops a column, drops a table, alters a column type, or otherwise loses data (the OD-R-6 destructive-migration policy).
- You're shipping a release-bundle commit that combines several migrations and want a single rollback point.
- You're not sure whether a queued migration is safe: when in doubt, checkpoint.

Skip it for routine non-destructive deploys (new columns, new indexes, additive seed data): the snapshot has a real cost and the routine path doesn't need it.

Example commit message:

```
Refactor | Phase 7 closeout (Checkpoint)

Drops the deprecated tomori_configs table after Phase 6 backfill.
Snapshot is required because the migration is destructive.
```

The `(Checkpoint)` token can appear anywhere in the subject or body: it's matched case-sensitively against the head commit's message. Manual workflow dispatch with the workflow's backup input enabled is the same lever for ad-hoc cases.

## What to do if a migration fails partway

If the bot crashes or hangs during migration:

1. **Stop the bot immediately**: do not let it retry migrations blindly.

2. **Check the logs**: TomoriBot logs to stdout/stderr by default (captured by your process manager or Docker logs). Look for an error message naming the migration that failed. Example output:

   ```
   Migration failed: 042_drop_old_column, error: column "old_column" does not exist
   ```

3. **Decide whether to restore**: if the error is unrecoverable (e.g., the migration tried to drop a column that doesn't exist), restore from your backup:

   ```bash
   # Option A restore
   bun run restore-backup --latest

   # Or Option B restore
   pg_restore \
     -h "$POSTGRES_HOST" \
     -p "$POSTGRES_PORT" \
     -U "$POSTGRES_USER" \
     -d "$POSTGRES_DB" \
     tomoribot-backup-20240115-143045.dump
   ```

4. **Roll back the code**: revert to the last working commit:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
   ```

   Use the hash you saved in step 3 of the pre-pull checklist, or find it with:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline | head -20
   ```

5. **Report the bug**: file an issue at [github.com/Bredrumb/TomoriBot/issues](https://github.com/Bredrumb/TomoriBot/issues) with:
   - Failed migration filename (from logs)
   - Full error message
   - Last successful commit hash
   - Your OS, Bun version (`bun --version`), and PostgreSQL version

## What is NOT auto-recoverable

Per the project's design (OD-R-6), **destructive migrations cannot be rolled back** by the migration runner. Examples:

- `DROP COLUMN name_here`: deleted rows are lost forever; no SQL script can recover them
- `DROP TABLE old_table`: entire table is gone
- Type narrowing (e.g., `VARCHAR(255) → VARCHAR(100)`): values longer than 100 characters are truncated

For these operations, **the only recovery is your backup**. Always back up before pulling if you're on an older version and a new refactor has shipped.

The migration runner's forward-only design is intentional: rollback files (`.down.sql`) exist for developer safety during testing, but production recovery relies on backups, not re-execution of undoable operations.

## Trying out a feature branch, then returning to `main`

A common case: someone asks you to test a branch on your existing install, and you want to know whether checking out the branch, booting it, then switching back to `main` will harm your database.

**The key facts:**

- Git and PostgreSQL are separate worlds. `git checkout` only swaps files on disk; it never connects to or modifies your database. Your applied-migration state lives in the `schema_migrations` table, not in git.
- Migrations run **automatically on boot** (via `initializeDatabase.ts`), so the moment you start the branch, its new migrations are applied to whatever database you pointed at.
- The forward runner **never auto-rolls-back**. When you return to `main`, it scans the files on disk, finds nothing pending, and does nothing. Migrations the branch applied stay applied.

**So is it safe?** It depends entirely on what the branch's migrations did:

- **Additive only** (new tables / new columns) → safe. The new objects simply sit unused; `main`'s code never references them, so they cannot cause wrong results or crashes. They are harmless dead weight.
- **Destructive** (`DROP`/`RENAME`/`ALTER` on a table `main` still uses) → not safe. The branch's change strands `main`'s code against a column/table that is now gone or altered.

**Safest approach:** point the branch at a throwaway database (a separate `POSTGRES_DB`), so your real data is never touched. You already build the connection from `POSTGRES_*` vars, and `bun run nuke-db` can reset a scratch database.

### Manually rolling back a test migration

If you tested a branch against your **real** database and want to undo its migrations afterward, use the rollback runner. Unlike the forward runner, it **never runs automatically**: rollback is always a deliberate manual act because `.down.sql` files are typically lossy.

```bash
# Preview only (dry run): show what would be rolled back
bun run migrate:down 034          # this migration + every newer applied one
bun run migrate:down --last       # only the most recently applied migration
bun run migrate:down --last=2     # the two most recently applied migrations

# Execute the rollback (runs the .down.sql files, removes schema_migrations rows)
bun run migrate:down 034 --yes
```

The command runs the selected `.down.sql` files in **descending** version order (so a migration's dependents are undone before it), then deletes the matching `schema_migrations` rows. With those rows gone, the forward runner will re-apply the migrations the next time you boot a branch that still ships them.

> **Run it while still on the branch.** The rollback reads `NNN_description.down.sql` from disk. Once you `git checkout main`, those files are gone and the rollback can no longer execute. Roll back first, then switch branches.

> **It is still lossy.** Rolling back `034` here runs `DROP TABLE short_term_memories`, so any data created while testing is gone. That is expected for a test cleanup, but never run `migrate:down` against data you want to keep without a backup.
