Handles persistent, database-backed memory writes initiated by the LLM via
tool calls during the tool-loop. Two tools cover the full CRUD surface:

| Stage | File | Tool name | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `01-ltm-create.md` | `MemoryTool` | `create_long_term_memory` | Inserts a new server or personal memory record |
| `02-ltm-update-delete.md` | `UpdateLongTermMemoryTool` | `update_long_term_memory` | Replaces or deletes an existing memory by its `ID:N` |

## Key design facts

- **Feature-flagged**: both tools require `self_teaching_enabled = true` in
  `TomoriState.config`. When disabled, the tool returns a user-reportable
  error without writing to the DB.
- **Persona-lineage scoping**: all DB writes use `persona_lineage_id`, not
  `persona_id`, so memories are shared across all personas of the same
  character lineage (different server instances of the same persona still
  see each other's memories).
- **Cache invalidation on success**: every successful write immediately
  invalidates the relevant TomoriState or user cache so the next
  context-build reads fresh DB state.
- **Dual scope**: memories are either `server_wide` (stored in
  `server_memories`, keyed by `server_id + persona_lineage_id`) or
  `target_user` (stored in `personal_memories`, keyed by
  `user_id + persona_lineage_id`).
- **Template placeholders**: content must use `{user}` and `{bot}` tokens
  instead of hardcoded names. Both tools strip unknown brace-wrapped tokens
  (e.g. `{obonya}`) via `sanitizeUnknownTemplatePlaceholders()` before the
  DB write.
