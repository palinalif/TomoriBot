title: "STM 01: Passive Capture"
---

Captures the completed conversation turn into the in-process short-term
memory cache immediately after generation finishes.

**Files:**
- `writeShortTermMemory` (module-private): `src/utils/chat/postTurnEffects.ts:129-181`
- `storeShortTermMemory`: `src/utils/cache/shortTermMemoryCache.ts:317-378`

## Mission

After every successful generation turn, `runPostTurnEffects` calls
`writeShortTermMemory`, which assembles a slice of the conversation history
and stores it so the context-build pipeline can surface it on the next turn
as cross-channel or cross-persona awareness.

The function takes the user/persona entries from `simplifiedMessages`, appends
the new persona responses from this turn, and writes the combined conversation
into the STM cache. `storeShortTermMemory` retains the most recent entries up to
`SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL`.
A separate write is issued for each unique responding `personaId` so that
personas with distinct IDs each maintain their own conversational continuity.

`storeShortTermMemory` writes two entries per call:

1. **User-scoped key** (`shortterm:user:userId:channelId[:personaId]`):
   enables the STM reader to scope retrieval to a specific user's history
   across all channels.
2. **Server-scoped key** (`shortterm:server:serverId:channelId[:personaId]`):
   enables the STM reader to retrieve server-shared history visible to all
   users in the same channel. Skipped for DM sessions (`serverId === "DM"`).

Any existing `summary` field from a prior `update_short_term_memory` call is
preserved: `storeShortTermMemory` carries forward `existing?.summary` when
constructing the new entry.

## Input

- `context: ChatTurnContext`: provides `simplifiedMessages`, `userDiscId`,
  `channel.id`, `serverDiscId`, `serverName`, `channelName`, `isDMChannel`,
  and `turn.requestSnapshot.triggererPrivacyLevel`.
- `result: GenerationTurnResult`: provides `personaResponses[]` (each entry
  has `text`, `personaId`, `personaLineageId`, `personaName`).

## Output

`Promise<void>`: no return value. The cache is updated as a side effect.

## Side effects

- **STM cache entries written**: two `Map` entries (user + server) per unique
  persona ID in `result.personaResponses`. In DM sessions, one entry only
  (user-scoped).
- **Durable scope rows ensured**: user and server identity rows are created if
  absent so later summary/category writes have durable targets. Crude messages
  themselves remain cache-only.
- **`stats.stores`**: incremented once per `storeMemoryEntry` call (internal
  to the cache module).

## Invariants

After this stage runs for a non-empty, non-stop generation result:

- The STM cache contains an entry for `(userDiscId, channelId, personaId)`,
  capped by `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL`.
- If a summary existed in a prior entry for this key, it is preserved in the
  new entry.
- The `lastUpdated` timestamp on the entry is set to `Date.now()` at write
  time.

## Skip conditions

`writeShortTermMemory` returns early (no write) when any of the following hold:

| Condition | Field checked |
|---|---|
| Turn was a stop-response | `context.isStopResponse` |
| No conversation history built this turn | `context.simplifiedMessages.length === 0` |
| Triggerer has `PrivacyLevel.FULL` | `context.turn.requestSnapshot.triggererPrivacyLevel` |
| No persona responded (empty result) | `result.personaResponses.length === 0` |

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `storeShortTermMemory()` | **A plugin extending channel-memory tagging or cross-server STM scoping would extend here.** The function signature accepts `personaId` and `personaLineageId` for scoping; new scope dimensions (e.g., thread lineage) would be added as additional parameters. → plugin plan candidate |
| TTL constants (`SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_TTL_HOURS`, `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL`) | Env-var configurable. Not a plugin seam: operational tuning only. |
| Message storage cap (`messages.slice(-MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL)`) | Internal; `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL` is the env-var control surface. |

## Configuration

| Source | Key / Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Env var | `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_TTL_HOURS` | `12` | Crude conversation TTL (hours) |
| Env var | `SHORT_TERM_MEMORY_MAX_MESSAGES_PER_CHANNEL` | `10` | Max messages stored per channel entry |
