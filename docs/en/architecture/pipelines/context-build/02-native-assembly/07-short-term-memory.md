title: "02.7: Short-Term Memory"
---

Recent conversation snippets from the DB-backed STM cache, plus tool-hint
emission (nudges) for the LLM to create and maintain short-term memory.

**File:** `src/utils/text/context/memories.ts:190-530`

## Mission

Surface two kinds of short-term memory to the LLM:

1. **Other-channel memories**: recent conversation summaries (or category
   blocks) from other channels in the same server (or cross-server if the
   user opted in).
2. **Same-channel memory**: the running summary or category block for the
   current channel (if one exists).

Separately, the contributor emits a single **unified nudge** (`nudgeItem`)
for the `update_short_term_memory` tool, gated by the cadence counter. The
same nudge covers BOTH cases ("no STM yet, please create one" and "STM
exists, please refresh it" and so there is no longer a distinct create vs.
update nudge. The nudge is returned out-of-band (not inside `memoryItems`)
so the pipeline can inject it at a configurable dialogue depth.

## Categories

Servers can configure up to `STM_MAX_CATEGORIES` (default 5) categories via
`/config` > Engine > Memory & STM. Each category has a `label`, `description`,
and `position`. The tool schema dynamically builds one string property per
category slug.

When only the default `summary` category exists, the system operates in
**single-summary fallback mode**: identical to pre-category behavior.

When additional categories are present, the system enters **category mode**.
Category-mode nudges support the `{category_labels}` placeholder, which is
replaced with the comma-separated list of configured labels.

## Render modes

Two render modes control how same-channel and other-channel memories are
presented in context:

| Mode | Key | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Crude + Summary (default) | `crude_summary` | Crude messages are always shown AND the summary/category block is appended additively alongside them. |
| Supersede | `supersede` | When a summary/categories exist, crude messages for that channel are replaced entirely by the summary/category block. |

Render mode only affects **other-channel** memories. A channel's own raw turns are
the live dialogue history, which is always present, so same-channel rendering is
identical under both modes. In `crude_summary` the summary/category block is
emitted **first**, followed by the `recent raw messages` block for that channel.

The default became `crude_summary` in migration 055, which also rewrote existing
rows. Servers with no `server_stm_configs` row (the common case, since the table is
not seeded at setup) get the same default from the runtime fallback in `memories.ts`.

The render mode is set per-server via `/config` > Engine > Memory & STM and stored in
`server_stm_configs.render_mode`.

## Cadence gating

A `turnsSinceRefresh` counter on each live STM row tracks
bot-participation cycles (not raw inbound messages). The counter is
incremented unconditionally by `incrementStmTurnCounter()` in post-turn
effects after each bot turn; it advances whether or not the bot actually
created/updated an STM; and is reset to `0` only when the bot calls
`update_short_term_memory` (`resetStmTurnCounter()`).

- **Unified nudge**: fires when `turnsSinceRefresh >= refreshCadence`
  (from `stmConfig`, default `5`). The same gate applies to both the
  create case (no STM yet) and the update case (existing STM). Because the
  counter keeps climbing until the bot uses the tool, the nudge re-appears
  every turn once due and only clears after a successful STM write.

When `turnsSinceRefresh` is undefined (channel with no STM row at all), it
defaults to `0`, so a fresh channel is not nudged until the bot has
participated in `refreshCadence` turns.

## Nudge injection depth

The nudge is injected positionally by the chat pipeline
(`insertAtDialogueDepth` in `contextAnnotations.ts`) at
`server_stm_configs.nudge_injection_depth`. Depth counts individual dialogue
TURNS from the bottom (a user turn and a bot turn are separate turns, **not**
pairs):

- `0`: tail, after every dialogue turn (literal last position)
- `1`: before the final turn
- `2`: before the latest user/bot pair (**default**; mirrors the legacy
  create-nudge placement)
- `N`: before the Nth turn from the bottom (clamps to the earliest dialogue
  turn when fewer than N exist, rather than jumping to tail)

Only `DIALOGUE_HISTORY` items are counted; `DIALOGUE_SAMPLE` example
dialogues are excluded from the walk.

## STM content block injection depth

By default the same/other-channel STM memory **content block** (`memoryItems`)
is pushed inline near the top of context (above sample dialogues and dialogue
history) as ambient knowledge; and, under a SillyTavern preset, flushed at the
`chatHistory`/`dialogueExamples` anchor. `server_stm_configs.content_injection_depth`
optionally moves that block to a dialogue depth instead, reusing the same
`insertAtDialogueDepth` walk as the nudge:

- `-1`: **default**: keep the block anchored near the top (legacy behavior); the
  block stays inline in `contextItems` and is NOT deferred.
- `0`: tail (the "last dialogue item"), after every dialogue turn.
- `N`: before the Nth dialogue turn from the bottom (same clamp semantics as the
  nudge).

When `content_injection_depth >= 0`, the builder withholds `memoryItems` from
`contextItems` and returns them out-of-band (`memoryInjectionItems` +
`memoryInjectionDepth`) so the pipeline can splice them positionally **after**
dialogue assembly; identical plumbing to the nudge, and correct under both native
and preset assembly.

**Content block vs. nudge ordering:** the pipeline injects the content block
*first*, then the nudge. When both depths are equal, each is spliced before the
same Nth dialogue turn, so the block (inserted first, in order) ends up directly
above the later-inserted nudge, i.e. the nudge always sits just below the block.

### Freshness override

Position in context reads as recency to the model: a summary sitting at the tail
implies "this is happening now". That is accurate while the conversation is live,
but once the channel has gone quiet the same placement presents stale content as
current.

So the resolved depth is not always the configured one. When the same-channel STM
entry is younger than `STM_FRESH_WINDOW_MINUTES` (default 60), the content block is
injected at `STM_FRESH_INJECTION_DEPTH` (default `2`) instead. Once the entry ages past
the window, the block snaps back to `content_injection_depth`.

`STM_FRESH_INJECTION_DEPTH` is a **ceiling, not a replacement**: the override may only
pull the block closer to the dialogue, never push it away.

| `content_injection_depth` | Fresh | Aged |
|---|---|---|
| `-1` (anchored top, default) | `2` | `-1` |
| `0` | `0` | `0` |
| `1` | `1` | `1` |
| `5` | `2` | `5` |

`-1` is the anchored-top sentinel rather than a real depth, so it is replaced outright
instead of being treated as "already closer".

Freshness is measured from the newest `lastUpdated` timestamp across all active memory entries being injected (either same-channel memory or any included other-channel memory). The per-turn crude write refreshes `lastUpdated` on every bot turn (the `refreshCadence` gate applies only to the *summary* write). So it tracks the last turn Tomori took part in, not the last time she wrote a summary. When no active memories exist, there is no age and the block is not fresh.

The override moves **only the content block**; the nudge stays at
`nudge_injection_depth`. Both default to `2`, so on a default server a fresh block and
the nudge land at the same depth and the equal-depth ordering above still holds (nudge
directly below the block). The guarantee only breaks if `nudge_injection_depth` is
raised above the resolved fresh depth, which puts the nudge above the block.

## Nudge / prompt customization

Two overridable prompt strings per server, stored in `server_stm_configs`:

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `tool_description_override` | Custom description for the `update_short_term_memory` tool schema |
| `update_nudge_override` | Custom text for the unified create/update nudge |

All overrides go through `sanitizeUnknownTemplatePlaceholders` after macro
expansion via `toolPromptMacroResolver.expand(...)`. In category mode,
`{category_labels}` is resolved before sanitization.

Configurable via `/config` > Engine > Memory & STM.

## DB persistence

STM is backed by the `short_term_memories` table with write-through cache:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scope_kind` | `server` or `user`: determines scoping |
| `categories` | JSONB: keyed by slug, values are category text |
| `summary` | TEXT: single-blob summary (fallback mode) |
| `turns_since_refresh` | Counter for cadence gating |

Every STM tool write updates both the in-memory cache and the durable DB
row. Reads hit the cache first with DB fallback.

### STM janitor

A periodic timer (`src/timers/stmJanitor.ts`) purges rows older than
`STM_JANITOR_RETENTION_DAYS` (default 90 days). This cleans up orphaned
STM rows for channels/servers that are no longer active.

## Input

Substantial: see signature in `memories.ts:190-203`. Notable:

- `triggeringUserId`, `currentChannelId`, `currentServerId`
- `tomoriState` (provides `persona_lineage_id`, `persona_id`,
  `llm.has_tools`, `llm.llm_provider`, `server_id`)
- `triggererName`, `botName`
- `personalMemoriesEnabled` (passed to `convertMentions`)
- `isUserImpersonation`
- `explicitLongTermMemoryIntent`: when true, suppresses the STM-tool hint
  (the user is asking for a long-term action, not short-term)
- `currentParentChannelId`: for private-channel inheritance in threads
- `toolPromptMacroResolver`, `convertMentions`

## Output

```ts
{
  memoryItems: StructuredContextItem[];   // 0..N STM content items
  nudgeItem?: StructuredContextItem;      // unified create/update nudge (out-of-band)
  nudgeInjectionDepth: number;            // dialogue depth for nudge injection (default 2)
  memoryInjectionDepth: number;           // content-block depth (-1 = inline/anchored)
}
```

`memoryInjectionDepth` tells the native builder where to place `memoryItems`: at
`-1` they are pushed inline into `contextItems` (anchored, legacy); at `>= 0` they
are forwarded out-of-band (`memoryInjectionItems` on the build result) for
positional injection by the pipeline.

Tagged `KNOWLEDGE_SHORT_TERM_MEMORY` on every emitted item. `role: "user"`
(not `system`) so they're interleaved with conversation flow rather than
sitting in the system header.

The native builder appends `memoryItems` to `contextItems` and forwards
`nudgeItem` + `nudgeInjectionDepth` (through `BuildContextResult`, preserved
across preset reassembly) to the chat pipeline's `appendTailDirectives`,
which calls `insertAtDialogueDepth` to splice the nudge in at the configured
depth after dialogue history is assembled.

## Side effects

- **STM config + category load**: `getStmConfig(serverId)` and
  `getStmCategories(serverId)` for render mode, cadence, nudge overrides,
  and category definitions.
- **STM cache reads**:
  - `getShortTermMemoriesForUser(userId, channelId, lineageId)`: for DMs
    or cross-server flow
  - `getShortTermMemoriesForServer(serverId, channelId, lineageId)`
    server-scoped
  - `getShortTermMemoryForUserChannel` / `getShortTermMemoryForServerChannel`
   : current-channel summary/categories
- **User row read**: `getCachedUserRow` for `shortterm_cache_crossserver_opt_in`.
- **Private-channel filtering**: if the current channel is *not* private
  and `stm_privacy_bypass` is false, drops STM entries whose
  `channelId` or `parentChannelId` is in `private_channel_ids`.
- **Cross-server folding**: when the user opted in *and* we're in a
  guild (not DM), other-server STM entries are folded into the
  "other-channel memories" list alongside same-server ones.
- **Tool-hint expansion**: `toolPromptMacroResolver.expand(...)` resolves
  `{short_term_memory_tool}` etc. for the active provider.
- **Nudge sanitization**: `sanitizeUnknownTemplatePlaceholders` strips
  unresolved `{placeholder}` tokens after macro expansion.
- **Mention conversion** on every emitted memory text.

## Invariants

After this stage runs:

- Returns `{ memoryItems: [], nudgeInjectionDepth: 0 }` on any unhandled
  error (logged, not thrown).
- Other-channel memories are sorted by `lastUpdated` DESC and capped at
  `MAX_OTHER_CHANNEL_MEMORIES` (default 3). Crude messages rendered in the
  Mode B additive blocks and the no-summary fallback listing are capped to
  the most recent `crude_message_count` (from `stmConfig`, falling back to
  `DEFAULT_CRUDE_MESSAGE_COUNT`).
- The same-channel summary/category item is emitted in `memoryItems`; the
  unified nudge is returned separately in `nudgeItem` for positional
  injection.
- The nudge is suppressed when: `llm.has_tools` is false,
  `llm_provider === "novelai"`, or `explicitLongTermMemoryIntent` is true
  (the user is asking for long-term action, the STM hint would compete).
- The nudge is gated by cadence: `turnsSinceRefresh >= refreshCadence` must
  be true, for both the create and update cases.
- In category mode, the nudge text includes the resolved `{category_labels}`
  list.

| Source | Field | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `server_stm_configs` | `refresh_cadence`, `render_mode`, `crude_message_count`, `nudge_injection_depth`, `content_injection_depth` | Cadence gating, render behavior, crude render cap, nudge position, content-block position |
| `server_stm_configs` | `tool_description_override`, `update_nudge_override` | Prompt customization |
| `stm_categories` | `label`, `description`, `position` | Dynamic category schema |
| `tomoriConfig` | `private_channel_ids`, `stm_privacy_bypass` | STM privacy filtering |
| `userRow` | `shortterm_cache_crossserver_opt_in` | Cross-server memory folding |

### Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/config` > Engine > Memory & STM | Configure cadence, render mode, crude message count, nudge depth, content depth |
| `/config` > Engine > Memory & STM | Set tool description and the unified nudge override |
| `/config` > Engine > Memory & STM | Define category labels and descriptions |
| `/config` > Persona > Memories | Hand-edit live STM for a persona in the current channel (Manage Server) |
| `/config` > Persona > Memories | Read-only inspect the live STM for a persona in the current channel (open to all members) |
| `/config` > Permissions | "Short-Term Memory" toggle: turns OFF the bot's automatic STM management (write tool + cadence nudge) while leaving STM content visible |
| `/help`, then Memory and Short-Term Memory | In-Discord guide to the STM customization surface |

> **Disabling STM:** the `short_term_memory_enabled` capability flag
> (`server_capabilities_configs`, migration 054, default `true`) controls the bot's
> *automatic* STM management; not whether STM appears at all. When off, two gates fire:
> (1) `UpdateShortTermMemoryTool.isAvailableForContext` returns `false` so the write tool
> is never offered, and (2) the cadence nudge is suppressed inside
> `buildShortTermMemoryContext`; `isStmToolAvailable` now folds in the same flag, so the
> nudge tracks the tool. **Memory content still renders:** `nativeBuilder.ts` always calls
> `buildShortTermMemoryContext`, so the same-channel block and other-channel recall keep
> surfacing. This lets admins curate STM by hand via `/config` > Persona > Memories (and keep crude
> messages visible) with the bot's auto-updates and nudges turned off. Stored
> `short_term_memories` rows are NOT deleted; the `/server stm …` and `/persona stm …`
> commands stay fully usable.

> **Scope note:** both the view and edit actions on `/config` > Persona > Memories resolve the exact row
> that gets injected; the **server-shared** row (`serverId, channelId, personaId`) in a
> guild, or the **user-scoped** row (`userId, channelId, personaId`) in a DM. There is no
> per-user STM inside a guild, so every member sees/edits the same shared blob.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| STM storage adapter (`shortTermMemoryCache.ts`, `ShortTermMemoryRepository.ts`) | Now DB-backed with write-through cache. Extension point is a custom storage adapter replacing the repository layer. |
| Same-channel summary/category format | Coupled to `update_short_term_memory` tool output; changing the format changes both. |
| Per-provider hint format | Nudge text is now server-configurable via overrides. Extension point shifts to per-provider hint formatting (e.g. different phrasing for different LLM providers). → plugin plan candidate. |
| Cross-server opt-in policy | Coupled to `user_personalization_configs.shortterm_cache_crossserver_opt_in`; user-facing toggle is `/personal config` (defined in `personal/config.ts`). |
| Provider-specific STM-tool availability | `llm_provider === "novelai"` hardcoded; a plugin adding a provider that doesn't support STM tools would extend this gate. AC-2 (name-switch purge) lists this as a violation to eliminate. → plugin plan candidate. |
