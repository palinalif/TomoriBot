title: "06.2: Response Sink"
---

Resolve the Discord delivery target and produce the sink callbacks that
generation will write through.

**File:** `src/utils/chat/responseEmitter.ts:62-99`

## Mission

The `ChatResponseSink` is the **seam between provider streaming and Discord
delivery.** Generation calls into the provider, the stream orchestrator
processes chunks, and the sink owns *where the rendered text lands*: an
alter-persona webhook, a temporary user-impersonation webhook, or the
plain-channel-send fallback. This stage builds that sink, including the
`prepare/emitStreamResult/emitError/finalize` callbacks, and stores the
resolved `responseTarget` on the carried context.

## Input

`ChatTurnContext` (from per-turn stage 01).

## Output

`ChatResponseSink`: see `src/utils/chat/types.ts:223-228`:

```ts
interface ChatResponseSink {
  prepare?(context): Promise<ChatResponseTarget | undefined>;
  emitStreamResult(result: StreamResult): Promise<void>;
  emitError(error: unknown): Promise<void>;
  finalize(result: GenerationTurnResult): Promise<void>;
  cleanup?(): Promise<void>;
}
```

The `ChatResponseTarget` returned by `prepare` (see
`src/utils/chat/types.ts:214-221`) carries:

- `webhook` / `temporaryWebhook`: Discord webhook for delivery (if any)
- `personaUsername`, `personaAvatarUrl`: display identity
- `prefixStrippingName`: for impersonation, strip this prefix from emitted
  text
- `webhookTargetChannel`: parent channel for thread-scoped webhooks

`undefined` target means "fall back to `channel.send` as the bot account."

## Side effects

**On `prepare()`:**

- Resolves the delivery target via `resolveResponseTarget`:
  - **User impersonation** (`isUserImpersonation` + `impersonatedUserId`):
    creates a *temporary* webhook with the impersonated user's display name
    and avatar via `webhookTargetChannel.createWebhook`. Cached via
    `cacheUserImpersonationWebhook`.
  - **Alter persona** (`currentPersona.is_alter`): resolves the
    server-owned persona webhook via `getOrCreateWebhook` and
    `resolvePersonaWebhookIdentity`.
  - **Main persona / DM / unsupported channel:** returns `undefined`.
- Sends a webhook-error embed (cooldown-throttled per channel) if webhook
  creation failed and the turn is deliberate enough to surface user errors.
- Updates the channel lock's `activeTurnState` with this turn's persona ID
  and impersonation flags; clears `isInToolCallChain`.

**On `emitStreamResult(result)`:**

- No-ops if `result.status !== "error"`.
- If `result.data` is a `ProviderError` (has `type` + `retryable`), returns
  immediately; the state machine's `StreamErrorUi.handleProviderError` already
  sent the specific embed (e.g. "🔴️ Provider Content Filter"). Sending again
  here would double-send.
- Otherwise (unexpected non-`ProviderError` data), logs and renders the generic
  "Generation Error" embed via `sendStandardEmbed`, gated on
  `context.shouldSurfaceUserErrors`.

**On `emitError(error)`:**

- Renders an error embed (or re-throws if `isUserImpersonation`, since
  impersonation errors must not surface as the impersonated user's
  "message"). Non-deliberate turns log the failure and stay quiet in chat.

**On `finalize(result)`:**

- Deletes the temporary impersonation webhook if one was created.
- Logs the response count and final status.

## Invariants

After `prepare()` runs:

- `context.responseTarget` is set (to the resolved target or `undefined`).
- The channel lock's `activeTurnState` reflects this turn's persona +
  impersonation identity.
- A temporary impersonation webhook, if created, will be deleted before
  `runGenerationTurn` returns, regardless of generation outcome.

After `finalize()` *or* `cleanup()` runs:

- Any temporary webhook created during `prepare` has been deleted (best-effort;
  failures are logged, not thrown).

`finalize` alone is not sufficient to guarantee this. `emitGenerationError`
rethrows for user impersonation, so the generation stage's own error handler
can throw and skip `finalize` entirely. `runGenerationTurn` therefore calls
`cleanup()` from a `finally` that wraps `prepare` as well as the attempt loop.
Deletion is guarded so the two entry points cannot both issue it.

## Extension points

**The `ChatResponseSink` interface itself is the extension point.** The sink
is constructed *per turn* and the same interface contract is consumed by
both the stream orchestrator (writes chunks) and the generation stage (calls
`prepare`/`finalize`). A plugin wanting to:

- **Intercept emitted text** (filter, transform, redact): wrap the sink's
  emit pathway. → plugin plan candidate; today there's no registration
  mechanism.
- **Add a new delivery target type** (e.g. Matrix relay, embedded reply):
  extend `resolveResponseTarget` with a new target-kind branch.
- **Customize webhook identity**: `resolvePersonaWebhookIdentity` and
  `resolveImpersonatedIdentity` are the named seams.

**Related but non-sink extensibility:**

- Webhook creation/fetch policy lives in `getOrCreateWebhook` in
  webhook manager (currently `webhookManager.ts` / `webhook/webhookCore.ts`; no dedicated subsystems doc yet).
- Stream-orchestrator-side rendering and chunking lives in
  [provider pipeline](../../provider/).

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBHOOK_ERROR_COOLDOWN_MS` | `600000` | Per-channel cooldown between webhook-error embeds |
