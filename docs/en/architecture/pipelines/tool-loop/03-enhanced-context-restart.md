title: "03: Enhanced Context Restart"
---

Consume a context-enrichment restart signal from a tool response and mutate
the live context before the loop continues.

**File:** `src/utils/chat/toolLoop.ts:333-364`

## Mission

Some tools respond with a `context_restart_*` typed payload instead of
normal result data. This signals that the tool has produced enriched context
that must be injected before the next provider call; rather than appending a
tool-response history entry and continuing, the loop restarts with a richer
context window.

`handleEnhancedContextRestart` inspects the tool result data, applies the
enrichment to `params.context.contextItems` and `params.context.streamingContext`,
and returns `true` to tell `executeToolCall` to return `{kind: "restart"}`.

This stage is called from within [stage 02: `executeToolCall`](02-execute-tool-call.md)
immediately after the registry dispatch. It only runs when `toolResult.success
=== true`.

## Input

- `params: ToolLoopParams`: full loop context; `contextItems` and
  `streamingContext` are mutated in place.
- `data: unknown`: the raw `toolResult.data` value from `ToolRegistry.executeTool`.
  Expected shape when a restart is triggered:
  ```ts
  {
    type: "context_restart_<suffix>";   // e.g. "context_restart_message_metadata"
    enhanced_context_item?: StructuredContextItem;  // inline payload
    pending_context_key?: string;                   // stashed payload (takes precedence)
  }
  ```

  A tool supplies its enrichment through exactly one of two transports:

  | Transport | Use when |
  |---|---|
  | `enhanced_context_item` | The item is small (a URL, a directive, plain text). YouTube passes a link this way. |
  | `pending_context_key` | The item carries bulk media. The tool calls `stashEnhancedContextItem()` (`src/utils/chat/pendingEnhancedContext.ts`) and returns only the key. |

  The stash exists because `ToolResult.data` is retained: `ToolRegistry` keeps the last
  1000 execution events, each holding a strong reference to its result. A base64 avatar
  or a set of GIF keyframes placed in `data` would stay resident for the process
  lifetime. `peek_profile_picture` and `process_gif` therefore use the stash.

## Output

`boolean`: `true` if a restart was triggered and applied; `false` if `data`
was not a restart signal (caller continues normally).

## Side effects

All mutations apply only when `data.type` starts with `"context_restart_"`.

**Message-metadata restart** (`type.includes("message_metadata")`):
- Calls `annotateRecentMessageMetadataInContext`: annotates recent messages
  in `contextItems` with author/timestamp metadata and patches reply references.
  Logs annotated and patched counts. When a turn merged several consecutive
  same-author messages (`combinedMessageIds`), it emits one `ref_N` + timestamp
  line per original constituent message so each remains individually targetable
  by `manage_message` / `interact_with_recent_message`.
- Appends a tail directive message block via `buildTailDirectiveMessage` +
  `buildRevealedMessageMetadataTailDirective` to `contextItems` when the
  directive is non-empty. The directive also instructs the model not to call
  `reveal_message_metadata` again this turn: tool prompt macros expand once at
  context-build time, so the system prompt still documents the tool after the
  reveal, and the directive is the only layer the restarted iteration re-reads.
- Sets `streamingContext.disableMessageMetadataContext = true` to prevent
  the context-build pipeline from re-injecting the same metadata on a
  subsequent turn, and to make the tool's own availability and execution
  guards reject a second reveal in this turn.

**All restart types:**
- Resolves the enrichment payload via `resolveEnhancedContextItem` and appends it to
  `contextItems` when present. `pending_context_key` is drained first (and removed from
  the stash so a later restart cannot replay stale media); `enhanced_context_item` is
  used otherwise. A key that resolves to nothing logs a warning: the turn continues
  without the media rather than failing, so the warning is the only signal.
- Sets the type-matched disable flag on `streamingContext`:

  | `type` contains | Disable flag set |
  |---|---|
  | `"youtube"` | `disableYouTubeProcessing = true` |
  | `"image"` | `disableProfilePictureProcessing = true` |
  | `"gif"` | `disableGifProcessing = true` |
  | `"message_metadata"` | `disableMessageMetadataContext = true` |

  Disable flags prevent the context-build pipeline from re-fetching the same
  resource on follow-up turns within the same channel lock window.

## Invariants

After this stage runs (when it returns `true`):

- `contextItems` contains the enriched item at the end of the list: the
  next `streamOnce` call will include it in the provider's context.
- The `context_restart_*` tool call is **not** appended to `functionHistory`.
  The provider will not see the tool's raw response; it sees only the
  enriched context that was injected.
- `consecutiveToolErrors` in the outer loop is reset to `0` (restarts are
  treated as success).
- The loop does `continue`; the iteration count advances but no history entry
  is pushed for this tool call.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `context_restart_*` type namespace | The seam: a tool that needs to inject enriched context before the next generation returns a `context_restart_<suffix>` payload. Adding a new suffix requires a matching `type.includes(...)` check here and a new disable flag if re-fetch prevention is needed. → plugin plan candidate |
| `enhanced_context_item` field | The enrichment contract: any `StructuredContextItem` can be injected; type determines how the provider interprets it |
| `pending_context_key` + `stashEnhancedContextItem()` | The same contract for bulk media; keeps multi-MB payloads out of the retained tool-execution history. Bounded by `ENHANCED_CONTEXT_STASH_TTL_MS` / `ENHANCED_CONTEXT_STASH_MAX_ENTRIES` |
| Disable flags on `StreamingContext` | Internal: flags are consumed by the context-build pipeline; adding a new flag requires both the restart handler and the context-build stage that checks it |
