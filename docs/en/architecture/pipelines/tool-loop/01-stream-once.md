title: "01: Stream Once"
---

One provider generation pass, wrapped with a rolling AbortController SDK timeout.

**File:** `src/utils/chat/toolLoop.ts:142-195`

## Mission

Call `provider.streamToDiscord(...)` with the current accumulated context and
tool history, and race the result against a configurable SDK timeout. The
timeout is *rolling*: it resets on every `onStreamProgress` heartbeat, so a
long but active stream is not killed; only a truly stalled one is. Returns a
`StreamResult` describing how the generation ended.

## Input

- `params: ToolLoopParams`: full loop context (provider, config, `ChatTurnContext`).
- `accumulatedModelParts: Array<Record<string, unknown>>`: provider-native model
  turn parts accumulated across prior iterations of the tool loop. Empty on the
  first iteration; grows as each tool call appends its model response. Passed by
  reference and read (not written) inside `streamOnce`.
- `functionHistory: ToolHistoryEntry[]`: paired call/response records from prior
  tool dispatches. Passed to the provider so it can continue the multi-turn tool
  conversation. Empty on the first call.

## Output

`Promise<StreamResult>`: defined in `src/types/provider/interfaces.ts`. The
`status` field drives the outer loop's switch:

| `status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"completed"` | Provider finished; `accumulatedText` carries the final response |
| `"error"` | Provider threw a non-timeout error |
| `"timeout"` | SDK call exceeded `STREAM_SDK_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` with no heartbeat |
| `"empty_response"` | Provider returned with no text and no tool call |
| `"stopped_by_user"` | User triggered `/kill` while streaming |
| `"follow_up_interrupt"` | A follow-up message arrived; caller should yield |
| `"function_call"` | Provider requested a tool call; `data` carries the call payload |

## Side effects

- **Sets `params.context.streamingContext.abortSignal`** to a fresh
  `AbortController.signal` before each call. Provider adapters consume this
  signal to abort in-flight HTTP requests when the timeout fires.
- **Sets `params.context.streamingContext.onStreamProgress`** to the
  `refreshTimeout` callback before the call and resets it to `undefined` in the
  `finally` block. Provider adapters call this on each token delivery to prevent
  the timeout from firing on active streams.
- **Registers `killStream` on the channel lock entry** via
  `setChannelStreamKill(channelId, killStream)`. `killStream` is a unified
  callback that both calls `abortController.abort()` *and* rejects the
  `Promise.race`: ensuring the HTTP request is cancelled and the race unblocks
  simultaneously. This is what `/kill` triggers via `forceKillChannelStream`.
- **Clears the timeout and the kill registration** (`clearTimeout`,
  `setChannelStreamKill(channelId, null)`) in the `finally` block regardless of
  success or error.
- **Derives the `replyToMessage` argument** passed to the provider. Queued turns
  (`isFromQueue`) normally reply to their trigger message so the response renders
  as a Discord reply. Scene turns are the exception: every queued scene persona
  job shares the *same* trigger message, so replying would make all of them render
  "replying to" one message. When `incoming.sceneTurn` is set, `replyToMessage` is
  forced to `undefined` so the generated scene reads as a free-standing dialogue.

## Invariants

After this stage runs:

- `params.context.streamingContext.onStreamProgress` is `undefined`: the
  heartbeat reference is always cleaned up.
- The channel lock's `activeStreamKill` is `null`: the kill callback is
  always deregistered in `finally`.
- If the result status is `"timeout"`, it originated from the SDK-call
  timeout race (error message prefix `"SDK_CALL_TIMEOUT:"`), not from a
  provider-specific timeout mechanism.
- Errors that are not SDK timeouts are re-thrown to the caller
  (`runToolLoop`), which does not catch them; they propagate to
  `runGenerationTurn`'s outer `catch`.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `provider.streamToDiscord(...)` call | The provider contract is the seam: see [provider pipeline](../provider/) |
| `STREAM_SDK_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` / rolling `onStreamProgress` | Internal: timeout behavior is an operational concern, not plugin-relevant |
| `params.context.streamingContext.abortSignal` | Internal: consumed by provider adapters only |

## Configuration

| Env var | Default | Minimum | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STREAM_SDK_CALL_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120000` (2 min) | `10000` (10 s) | Idle timeout for one provider call; resets on each heartbeat |
