Streams an LLM response from a provider API to one or more Discord messages, handling all text processing, delivery timing, and stop signals between the provider's HTTP stream and Discord's message API.

The pipeline is entered from [tool-loop stage 01: `streamOnce`](../tool-loop/01-stream-once) via
`LLMProvider.streamToDiscord()`. That facade method constructs a `StreamAdapter` and a `StreamConfig`,
then hands both to `StreamOrchestrator.streamToDiscord()`, which drives the remaining stages.

## Read order

1. `README.md`: this file (pipeline overview and entry-point wiring)
2. `01-context-assembly.md`: adapter translates `StructuredContextItem[]` into provider-native format
3. `02-raw-chunk-generation.md`: HTTP stream opens; `RawStreamChunk` objects are yielded
4. `03-chunk-normalization.md`: `processChunk` converts `RawStreamChunk` → `ProcessedChunk`
5. `04-orchestrator-state-machine.md`: `executeStream` drives the for-await loop and routes chunk types
6. `05-buffer-management.md`: `StreamBufferFlusher` accumulates text and flushes at boundaries
7. `06-segment-normalization.md`: `StreamSegmentProcessor` cleans text and resolves Discord-specific concerns
8. `07-discord-delivery.md`: `StreamMessageDelivery` + `StreamUiUpdater` send messages to Discord

## Pipeline-wide concerns

### Provider identity

`LLMProvider.streamToDiscord()` is defined on each provider class (e.g., `GoogleProvider`,
`OpenrouterProvider`). The method constructs a provider-specific `StreamAdapter` but immediately
delegates to the universal `StreamOrchestrator`. Stages 1-3 are therefore provider-owned (each
adapter handles its own API format); stages 4-7 are orchestrator-owned and provider-agnostic.

### Stop and interrupt signals

The stop registry (`src/utils/discord/stream/stopRequests.ts`) is a per-channel map checked at
every iteration of the stage 4 orchestrator loop. Two stop modes exist:
- **User stop** (`status: "stopped_by_user"`): `/kill` command; pending buffer is flushed before returning.
- **Follow-up interrupt** (`status: "follow_up_interrupt"`): a new user message arrived; buffer is
  discarded and the pipeline exits immediately to allow the chat pipeline to re-run.

### Delivery modes

Controlled by `HumanizerDegree` (from `TomoriState.config`):

| Degree | Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `NONE` (0) | Aggregated | Text is queued until a tool/final boundary, then sent in one batch |
| `LOW`/`MEDIUM` (1-2) | Streaming | Each segment is sent as it flushes; typing simulation runs between messages |
| `HEAVY` (3) | Streaming + humanize | Like degree 1-2 but `humanizeString()` applies additional noise |

### Persona and webhook routing

When `StreamContext.webhook` and `StreamContext.personaUsername` are set (alter persona mode),
stage 7 routes all Discord sends through `sendWebhookMessageWithIdentity()` so the message
appears with the persona's name and avatar. The first message in an alter response that also has
a `replyToMessage` context gets a separate reply-notice via `sendWebhookReplyNotice()` before
the main content send.

### Thought log capture

`<think>…</think>` blocks in the streamed text are silently captured into
`state.thinkBlockBuffer` (stage 5) rather than sent to Discord. At stream end, stage 4
assembles these into `StreamResult.thoughtLog` for the thought-log embed that stage 04 of the
tool-loop pipeline emits to a dedicated channel.

### `<details>` block capture

`<details>…</details>` blocks are captured into `state.detailsBlockBuffer` (stage 5) and
routed to `StreamResult.detailsContent`. Stage 04 of the tool-loop pipeline writes
`detailsContent` to the short-term memory cache separately from `accumulatedText`.
