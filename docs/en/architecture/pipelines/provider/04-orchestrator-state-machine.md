title: "04: Orchestrator State Machine"
---

Drives the provider generator as a state machine, routing each `ProcessedChunk` and resolving stop signals, timeouts, and stream completion into a `StreamResult`.

**File:** `src/utils/discord/stream/stateMachine.ts:119-485`

## Mission

`StreamOrchestrator.executeStream()` is the central coordinator of the Discord-side pipeline.
It owns the `for await` loop over the stage 02 generator and makes the per-chunk decisions that
determine the shape of the final `StreamResult`. Three concerns are woven through the loop:

1. **Stop / interrupt resolution**: the stop registry is checked both before processing each
   chunk and again immediately after it is written out. A user stop (`/kill`) flushes the pending
   buffer and returns `{ status: "stopped_by_user" }`. A follow-up interrupt discards the buffer
   and returns `{ status: "follow_up_interrupt" }` so the chat pipeline can restart for the new
   message. The post-write check exists because delivery-side stops (the send and flush limits in
   stage 07) are raised *during* the write; resolving them there cancels the upstream response one
   chunk sooner than waiting for the next loop iteration would.

   A stop the delivery layer raised itself skips the flush instead of taking it. The stop request is
   cleared before the flush runs, so a flush would reach the send path with nothing left to consult
   and post the buffered text as a real Discord call: for a destination the bot cannot post into
   that is a second rejected send, and the stop it raises on the way out is registered after the
   clear, so it outlives the stream and silently aborts the next turn. The skip list covers the send
   and flush limits for the same reason they are raised at all.

2. **Chunk routing**: after stop checks, the `ProcessedChunk.type` determines the path:
   - `"text"` → stage 05 (`StreamBufferFlusher.processTextChunk`)
   - `"function_call"` → flush the pending buffer → return `{ status: "function_call", data: functionCall }`
   - `"error"` → flush the pending buffer → display an error embed if not suppressed →
     return `{ status: "error", data: error }`
   - `"done"` → record `terminalDoneMetadata` (finish reason); continue the loop (generator will
     exhaust on the next `await`)
   - **Token usage**: on *any* chunk (not just `"done"`), if `metadata.usage` is present it is
     normalized (`normalizeProviderUsage`) into `state.usage`, latest-wins. This captures providers
     that emit usage on a trailing empty-choices chunk (OpenAI `include_usage`) or that clobber the
     terminal `done` metadata (Anthropic `message_stop`). `state.usage` is drained into
     `StreamResult.usage` on the `function_call` and `completed` results.

3. **Inactivity timeout**: a rolling `setTimeout` resets on every chunk (`resetInactivityTimer`).
   If no chunk arrives for `config.inactivityTimeoutMs`, `state.timedOut = true`. The loop detects
   this flag on the next iteration (or at generator exhaust) and returns `{ status: "timeout" }`.

After the generator exhausts normally, `completeStreamAfterProviderEnd()` runs the final flush
path (stage 05 `flushFinalBuffer`), checks for timeout, and assembles the completed `StreamResult`.

The outer `streamToDiscord()` method (the public entry point) calls `executeStream()` and then
does one additional check: if the result is `"completed"` but `wasEmptyStreamResponse()` is true
(no text and no function call were emitted), it returns `{ status: "empty_response" }` instead,
so the tool-loop pipeline's retry logic can handle it.

## Input

- `provider: StreamProvider`: the stage 02/03 adapter (generator + `processChunk`).
- `config: StreamConfig`: timing and buffer size configuration.
- `context: StreamContext`: full Discord and application state (channel, tomoriState, etc.).

`StreamMetrics` and `StreamState` objects are created fresh at the start of `executeStream()`.

## Output

`StreamResult`: defined at `src/types/provider/interfaces.ts:88`:

```ts
interface StreamResult {
  status:
    | "completed"        // generator exhausted; text was sent
    | "function_call"    // provider requested a tool; tool-loop handles it
    | "error"            // provider or Discord error
    | "timeout"          // inactivity timer expired
    | "stopped_by_user"  // user /kill command
    | "empty_response"   // completed but no text or function call
    | "follow_up_interrupt"; // new user message arrived during generation
  data?: unknown | Error;
  accumulatedText?: string;    // all text sent to Discord (for STM write)
  detailsContent?: string;     // <details> block body (for STM write)
  stopReason?: StreamStopReason;
  thoughtLog?: ThoughtLogPayload;
  naiContinuationPrefill?: string; // NAI-specific trailing fragment for retry
  spritesShown?: SpriteShownEntry[]; // { name, isIdentity } per delivered sprite (sprite_shown + sprite_emotion attribution)
  usage?: TokenUsage;              // real provider token usage, normalized (when surfaced)
}
```

`usage` carries the provider's real `{ inputTokens, outputTokens }` for this segment when the
provider reports it (OpenRouter, OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Gemini). The post-turn stat
recorder (`recordUsageStats`) sums it across the turn's segments; each tool-loop request is
billed separately, so the sum is billing-accurate, and falls back to the character estimate
(`@/utils/text/tokenEstimate`) only when no segment surfaced usage.

## Side effects

- **Inactivity timer**: a `setTimeout` is set on entry and cleared in `finally`. The timer runs
  against `NodeJS.Timeout`; it is always cleared before the method returns.
- **Stop-request mutation**: `clearStopRequest(channelId)` is called on exit paths that consumed
  a stop. The stop registry is a shared module-level map in `stopRequests.ts`.
- **Error embed**: when `chunk.type === "error"` and `!context.suppressUserErrors`, calls
  `StreamErrorUi.handleProviderError()` which sends a Discord embed to the channel. The embed is
  composed centrally: a provider's localized headline (`createErrorDescription`) followed by the
  **raw provider detail** for every error type, extracted via `getProviderErrorDetail` and
  truncated to Discord's embed description limit. This means providers that map known codes to
  hardcoded locale strings (e.g. OpenRouter) no longer hide the actual provider message; the detail
  is de-duped so a provider that already appended it is not echoed twice. Recognized `model_error`
  failures additionally get a dedicated "Model Configuration Error" title. This is the **sole**
  embed send path for `ProviderError` types: the downstream response sink (`emitStreamResult` in
  `responseEmitter.ts`) deliberately skips the generic fallback embed when `result.data` is a
  `ProviderError`, to avoid double-sending.
- **Timeout embed**: when the inactivity timer fires and user errors are not suppressed, sends
  a timeout embed via `sendStandardEmbed()`.
- **Progress callback**: calls `context.onStreamProgress?.()` on each chunk to reset the
  rolling timeout in the stage 01 caller (`streamOnce` in the tool-loop pipeline).
- **`currentTurnModelParts` accumulation**: stage 05 (`processTextChunk`) pushes text parts into
  `context.currentTurnModelParts` as a side effect; the orchestrator does not do this directly.

## Invariants

After this stage:

- Exactly one `StreamResult` is returned; the method never throws to its caller
  (`streamToDiscord` catches all errors and converts them to `{ status: "error" }`).
- The inactivity timer has been cleared unconditionally (via `finally`).
- If `status === "function_call"`, `result.data` is a `FunctionCall` and
  `result.accumulatedText` contains all text sent to Discord before the tool call.
- If `status === "completed"`, all buffered text has been flushed (including final `<think>`
  and `<details>` block captures).
- `clearStopRequest` has been called for any stop that was consumed during this stream.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `StreamOrchestrator.streamToDiscord()` public method | The universal Discord streaming entry point: `src/types/stream/interfaces.ts:313`. All providers delegate here. Internal: the orchestrator is not designed to be replaced; new providers plug in via the `StreamProvider` adapter contract. |
| Stop registry (`requestStop`, `hasStopRequest`, `clearStopRequest`) | `src/utils/discord/stream/stopRequests.ts`. The stop registry is a shared per-channel state map. A plugin that wants to interrupt streaming (e.g., a moderation system) would call `StreamOrchestrator.requestStop(channelId, requesterId)`. → plugin plan candidate |
| `context.onStreamProgress` callback | Set by the tool-loop pipeline (`streamOnce`) before calling `streamToDiscord`. The orchestrator calls it on each chunk. Internal: the callback is an operational heartbeat, not a plugin seam. |
| `StreamResult` status union | Consumed by the tool-loop pipeline's outer switch. Adding a new status requires changes in both the orchestrator and the tool-loop consumer. Internal until the tool-loop plugin contract is defined. |
| `context.suppressUserErrors` | When `true`, error and timeout embeds are not sent to Discord (used during retries in `runGenerationTurn`). Internal: set by the chat pipeline's key-rotation loop. |

## Configuration

| Source | Key / Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StreamConfig` / env var | `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `120 000` ms | Time with no chunk before stream is considered stalled |
| `TomoriState.config` | `send_message_limit` | `0` (no limit) | Maximum Discord messages per stream; enforced in stage 07 |
