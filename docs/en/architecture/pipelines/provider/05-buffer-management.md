title: "05: Buffer Management"
---

Accumulates streamed text into semantic buffers and flushes discrete segments to stage 06 when a delivery boundary is detected.

**File:** `src/utils/discord/stream/bufferFlusher.ts:35-342`

## Mission

`StreamBufferFlusher.processTextChunk()` is called by the stage 04 orchestrator for every
`ProcessedChunk` with `type === "text"`. It maintains the primary streaming buffer
(`state.buffer`) and two capture buffers (`state.thinkBlockBuffer`,
`state.detailsBlockBuffer`), routing incoming text to whichever buffer is currently active
based on semantic block markers in the stream.

After routing, it calls `processStreamBufferContent()` (from `bufferManager.ts`) in a loop to
detect flush boundaries within `state.buffer` and emit discrete segments to stage 06 via
`StreamSegmentProcessor.sendBufferSegment()`. The loop runs until no more boundaries are
detected or a stop request arrives.

Three flush paths exist beyond the main `processTextChunk` loop:

- **`flushFinalBuffer()`**: called by the stage 04 orchestrator after the generator exhausts.
  Sends any remaining `state.buffer` content, releases held orphan punctuation, drains unterminated
  think/details blocks to their respective stores, and triggers the aggregated-mode batch send.

- **`flushPendingBuffer()`**: called when a `function_call` chunk or a stop request arrives mid-
  stream. Sends the buffer *up to* a clean clause boundary (trailing incomplete clause trimmed when
  called with `trimTrailingIncompleteClause: true`), then releases the aggregated-mode buffer.

- **Overflow flush**: when `state.buffer` grows beyond `FLUSH_BUFFER_SIZE_REGULAR` without
  hitting a sentence boundary, a safe word-break index is found via `findRegularOverflowFlushIndex`
  and the buffer is flushed in segments until it is back under the limit.

### Markdown table atomicity

A Markdown table must reach stage 06 as one intact block: `extractMarkdownTableSegments` only
recognizes a table when its header, separator, and body rows arrive together, and any fragment that
fails to parse is delivered as raw pipe-delimited text instead of a rendered PNG. Two mechanisms in
this stage protect that:

- **Overflow snapping**: table rows end in newlines, so every sentence/whitespace heuristic in
  `findRegularOverflowFlushIndex` treats a row boundary as a safe break. Each candidate index is run
  through `findMarkdownTableBlockAt` and, when it lands strictly inside a table, moved back to the
  table's start (preferred: the whole table stays together for the next flush) or forward past its
  end. When neither is possible the function returns `0`, and `processTextChunk` breaks out of the
  overflow loop to hold the buffer for the final flush.

- **Marker repair scoping**: `autoCloseIncompleteMarkers` counts unbalanced inline markers over
  *prose only* and lands the closers at the end of the last prose segment, ahead of that segment's
  trailing whitespace. Because EOF never terminates a table block, every response ending in a table
  reaches the final flush with `hasSemanticMarkers === true`; appending a closer at the buffer's end
  would put it on the last table row, changing that row's cell count so the renderer drops it. Cell
  contents like `user_id`, a `Best*` footnote, or `(approx` are not unclosed inline markdown and are
  excluded from the counts for the same reason. A buffer that is nothing but a table is left
  untouched.

### Parenthesis balance and multi-message splitting

`hasIncompleteSemanticMarkers` counts only **unmatched openers**: the running total clamps at zero,
so a `)` with no `(` before it is discarded rather than banked. Both halves of that matter, because a
`true` here suppresses the newline break in `processStreamBufferContent` and defers the buffer to the
final flush.

- A net-negative total can never return to zero. The buffer only grows, and text is ordered, so no
  later `(` can match a `)` that already passed. Counting orphan closers therefore stalled the split
  permanently: one emoticon (`B)`, `:)`, `>:)`) merged the rest of the response into a single
  message, and because only a *segment-opening* `Persona (sprite):` label is consumed by
  `parseLeadingRenderModifier` (stage 06), every later label in that response shipped as visible
  text.
- Clamping also stops an orphan closer from offsetting a real opener back to a balanced-looking
  total, which would let `"we won :) (barely"` split in the middle of an open parenthetical: exactly
  what the hold exists to prevent.

`stripLeakedOwnNameLabels` (stage 06) carries the matching safety net: a decorated
`Persona (sprite):` label stranded mid-body is stripped at its turn boundary. That strip is scoped to
the boundary and opening-chain passes, never the leaked-preamble pass, which drops everything before
the label it matches and would delete the real reply preceding a stray one.

The final auto-close pass uses the same clamped opener count. An orphan closer before a later opener,
as in `B) (barely`, cannot mask the missing final `)` after streaming ends.

### Semantic block detection

`drainThinkBlocksFromBuffer(state)` and `drainDetailsBlocksFromBuffer(state)` scan `state.buffer`
for `<think>` / `</think>` and `<details>` / `</details>` boundaries after each chunk is appended.
While `state.isInsideThinkBlock` is `true`, incoming text is routed to `state.thinkBlockBuffer`
instead of `state.buffer`. The completed block content is stored in `state.thoughtRawSegments`
on close; it never reaches Discord. Similarly, `state.isInsideDetailsBlock` routes to
`state.detailsBlockBuffer`; on close the content goes to `state.detailsSegments` for STM write.

### Deduplication

`deduplicateIncomingTextChunk()` checks the incoming text against a rolling tail of recently
accumulated text (last `STREAM_CHUNK_DEDUP_TAIL_CHARS` characters of `accumulatedText +
pendingAggregatedText + buffer`). This guards against providers that occasionally re-emit the
last few tokens of the previous chunk in the next delivery.

## Input

- `textContent: string`: raw text content from the `ProcessedChunk`.
- `config: StreamConfig`: provides `flushBufferSize`, `flushBufferSizeCodeBlock`, and timing.
- `context: StreamContext`: channel ID (stop checks), `currentTurnModelParts` (accumulation),
  `suppressTextOutput` flag.
- `textConfig: TextProcessingConfig`: humanizer degree and delivery mode (aggregated vs. streaming).
- `typingConfig: TypingSimulationConfig`: typing speed parameters forwarded to stage 06.
- `state: StreamState`: the mutable per-stream state object (buffer, block flags, counters).
- `metrics: StreamMetrics`: `totalCharacters` is incremented here.

## Output

No return value. All output is produced as side effects on `state` and via calls to stage 06
(`sendBufferSegment`).

## Side effects

- **`state.buffer`**: mutated: text appended, segments flushed (string truncated).
- **`state.isInsideCodeBlock`** / **`state.isInsideThinkBlock`** / **`state.isInsideDetailsBlock`**:
  toggled when block boundaries are detected.
- **`state.thinkBlockBuffer`** / **`state.detailsBlockBuffer`**: accumulated while inside their
  respective blocks; drained when the block closes.
- **`state.thoughtRawSegments`** / **`state.detailsSegments`**: appended to when a think/details
  block closes or when `flushFinalBuffer()` captures an unclosed block.
- **`context.currentTurnModelParts`**: non-empty, non-whitespace text is pushed as
  `{ text: content }` parts so the provider adapter can replay accumulated output when
  constructing function-interaction history.
- **`metrics.totalCharacters`**: incremented by the length of the deduplicated chunk.
- **`state.hasSemanticMarkers`**: set when `state.buffer` contains an open semantic marker;
  cleared on buffer flush or `autoCloseStreamBufferMarkers()` in the final flush.

## Invariants

After `processTextChunk` returns for any given chunk:

- If `context.suppressTextOutput` was true, no segment was forwarded to stage 06.
- If a stop request was detected mid-loop, the method returned early without sending further
  segments; the caller (stage 04) handles the stop.
- `state.buffer` contains only the unflushed tail (text after the last flush boundary).
- Code block state (`isInsideCodeBlock`) accurately reflects the most recent open/close event seen
  in `state.buffer`.

After `flushFinalBuffer()`:

- `state.buffer` is empty.
- `state.thinkBlockBuffer` and `state.detailsBlockBuffer` are empty (captured to segments).
- Aggregated-mode pending text has been sent to Discord.
- `state.isInsideCodeBlock` and `state.hasSemanticMarkers` are `false`.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `processStreamBufferContent()` (in `bufferManager.ts`) | Internal: boundary detection (sentence, code block, newline) is tightly coupled to Discord message formatting constraints. The `flushBufferSize` configuration (`StreamConfig`) is the operational surface. |
| `drainThinkBlocksFromBuffer()` / `drainDetailsBlocksFromBuffer()` | Internal: semantic block capture routes are tightly coupled to the think/details tag conventions used by TomoriBot's prompts. |
| `findRegularOverflowFlushIndex()` | Internal: overflow flush breakpoint logic; coupled to Discord's 2000-character message limit. Returns `0` when every candidate breakpoint would split a Markdown table, which callers must treat as "hold the buffer". |
| `findMarkdownTableBlockAt()` (in `utils/text/markdownTable.ts`) | Internal: reports the table block enclosing an offset so flush logic can avoid splitting it. A plugin adding another atomic block type would need equivalent protection here. |
| Chunk deduplication (`STREAM_CHUNK_DEDUP_MIN_CHARS`, `STREAM_CHUNK_DEDUP_TAIL_CHARS`) | `src/utils/discord/stream/constants.ts`. Internal: a workaround for overlapping chunk delivery; no plugin-relevant seam. |

## Configuration

| Source | Key / Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `FLUSH_BUFFER_SIZE_REGULAR` | `1000` chars | Overflow flush threshold for non-code-block text |

| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `MAX_SINGLE_MESSAGE_LENGTH` | `1950` chars | Message length cap forwarded to stage 07 via `config.maxMessageLength` |
| `StreamConfig` | `flushBufferSize` / `flushBufferSizeCodeBlock` | From constants above | Configurable per-provider override (currently matches constants) |
| `TomoriState.config` | `uncensor_unicode_space_enabled` | `false` | Passed to `TextProcessingConfig`; used in stage 06 cleaning |
