title: "07: Discord Delivery"
---

Delivers a normalized text segment to Discord, applying typing simulation and routing through webhooks for persona mode.

**Files:**
- `StreamMessageDelivery.sendSegment`: `src/utils/discord/stream/messageDelivery.ts:154-194`
- `StreamUiUpdater.sendSinglePayload`: `src/utils/discord/stream/uiUpdater.ts:51-~230`

## Mission

This is the final stage of the provider pipeline: text that has passed through stages 05 and 06
is delivered to Discord. Two classes share the responsibility:

Sticker tools use a post-turn companion path rather than this text pipeline.
`runToolLoop` carries the latest successful cached `Sticker` only on a
completed `GenerationTurnResult`; `runPostTurnEffects` then sends it after the
streamed text. Alter personas send the sticker URL through their identity
webhook (including the thread ID when applicable). Main personas send the
native Discord sticker as a reply for queued turns or directly to the channel
otherwise. Webhook failure falls back to the native bot sticker send, and a
final sticker-send failure is logged without failing the completed turn.

**`StreamMessageDelivery.sendSegment()`** makes the delivery-mode decision:

- **Aggregated mode** (`HumanizerDegree.NONE`): the segment is queued into
  `state.pendingAggregatedText` via `queueAggregatedSegment()`. Aggregated text is only sent to
  Discord when a flush boundary that forces output arrives: a tool call, a final flush, or a
  Markdown table attachment. This produces a single, uninterrupted Discord message from what would
  otherwise be many small streaming messages. A render-modifier identity override flushes any
  pending aggregate first and sends immediately through the webhook path, because webhook identity
  is line-scoped and cannot be mixed into the regular aggregate buffer.

- **Streaming mode** (degree 1-3): the segment is split into Discord-safe chunks via
  `chunkMessage()`, then optionally humanized (degree 3 only: `humanizeString()`), and sent
  through one of two paths:
  - **With typing simulation** (degree 1-2): `sendChunksWithTyping()` sends the first chunk
    immediately, then inserts an interruptible typing delay (`interruptibleDelay()`) between
    subsequent chunks scaled to `chunk.length × baseSpeedMsPerChar` (capped at `maxTypingTimeMs`,
    minimum `minVisibleDurationMs`). An optional random "thinking pause" (`thinkingPauseChance`)
    adds further natural variance. Each delay is interruptible; it polls `hasStopRequest()`
    every 250 ms and returns early if a stop is pending.
  - **Immediate** (no simulation): `sendChunksImmediate()` sends all chunks back-to-back.

**`StreamUiUpdater.sendSinglePayload()`** executes the Discord API call for a single message
payload. It handles:

- **Send-message-limit enforcement**: if `state.messageSentCount >= config.send_message_limit`
  (server-configured cap), a stop is requested and the send is skipped. The absolute safety cap
  `STREAMING_LIMITS.MAX_FLUSH_COUNT` is also enforced here with a user-facing embed (suppressed
  under user impersonation, like every other notice in this subsystem).
  Both caps resolve as stop requests for every delivery mode, including impersonation. They are
  deterministic, so raising them as errors would only drive the generation stage to retry across
  rotation keys and fallback models against a condition no retry can satisfy.
- **Webhook path**: when `context.webhook` and `context.personaUsername` are set (alter persona
  mode), the message is sent via `sendWebhookMessageWithIdentity()` with the persona's name and
  avatar. Webhooks cannot use Discord's native reply, so for the *first* message of any webhook
  response that has a `replyToMessage`, a standalone reply notice is sent first via
  `sendWebhookReplyNotice()`. This covers the main persona too whenever a sprite pushes it onto the
  webhook path; the notice is gated on webhook delivery, not on `is_alter`. Sprite identity
  overrides (carrying a `spriteRecord`) still get the notice since the persona is speaking as itself;
  **copied** identities (impersonating a user or another persona) are excluded, because a notice
  posted under the disguise would attribute the reply to the wrong speaker.
- **Delivered-identity recording**: after every successful send, the identity Discord actually
  saw is recorded per channel in `channelDeliveryContinuity.ts`: the webhook identity on a
  webhook send, or a cleared marker on an ordinary bot send. Post-turn artifacts (stickers, the
  "Fallback Used" notice) read it back so they post as the same author and group with the
  message they follow, instead of splitting off under the persona's default name.
- **Render-modifier identity override**: when stage 06 resolves `SourcePersona (modifier): text`,
  the payload carries `identityOverride`. The UI updater lazily creates or reuses the managed
  channel webhook even for the main persona. Ordinary sprite matches send with the clean username
  `SourcePersona` and the sprite avatar; identity sprites (`persona_sprites.is_identity`) and
  copied-identity matches send with the flipped username `target (SourcePersona)` and the
  target's/sprite avatar (the model-facing context label stays `SourcePersona (target)`).
  Ordinary main-persona output
  remains a regular bot message; the managed webhook is used only for override payloads. Unknown,
  ambiguous, or unusable modifiers are stripped before this stage and therefore follow the regular
  path.
- **Sprite message persistence**: payloads carrying a `spriteRecord` write a
  `persona_sprite_messages` row fire-and-forget after a successful *webhook* send (bot-fallback
  sends are skipped; they cannot carry persona identity in context). Context rebuilding uses
  this mapping to recover the decorated `SourcePersona (sprite):` label; a lost row degrades the
  label to the plain persona name, never an error.
- **Regular path**: otherwise the message is sent via `context.channel.send()` or
  `context.replyToMessage.reply()` (first message only), with `allowedMentions` set to suppress
  `@everyone` / `@here` pings while allowing user and role mentions.
- **State tracking**: on a successful send: `state.messageSentCount++`, `state.accumulatedText`
  is appended, and `state.firstReplyUrl` is set on the first message sent (used in thought-log embeds).
  The message's `{ messageId, channelId, isWebhook }` is also appended to
  `context.deliveredMessageRefs` when that shared sink is present, so a later fallback attempt can
  delete this attempt's partial output if it is superseded (see
  [06.3 Generation Turn](../chat/06-per-turn/03-run-generation-turn) → superseded-message cleanup).
  For render-modifier payloads, `state.accumulatedText` is prefixed with the model-facing
  source-first label (`SourcePersona (modifier): `), which may differ from the visible webhook
  username (clean name for sprites, flipped name for copied identities), so result capture,
  STM, and future prompt context remain reversible.
- **Invalid-webhook recovery**: if the webhook send fails with Discord error 10015 or 50027
  (unknown/invalid webhook), the webhook cache is invalidated and a fresh webhook is fetched for
  retry.
- **Progress notification**: `context.onStreamProgress?.()` is called after a successful send,
  resetting the rolling SDK timeout in the tool-loop pipeline.

## Rendered Markdown tables

`sendRenderedMarkdownTable()` bypasses `chunkMessage()` entirely: the table is rasterized by
`renderMarkdownTableToPng()` and sent as a PNG attachment, because Discord's Markdown dialect has
no table support and raw pipe rows render as unaligned text.

The message carries a single **Show Markdown** button (`createShowMarkdownButtonRow`,
`src/utils/discord/markdownTableButton.ts`), following the same collector pattern as the
`Fallback Used` notice:

- Pressing it replies **ephemerally** with the table's original Markdown inside a
  ` ```markdown ` fence, so a viewer can copy the source the image was rendered from.
- Source text is read from `markdownTableCache` (keyed by message ID) on each press rather than
  captured in the collector closure, so the collector does not pin every rendered table's source in
  memory. A press after the cache TTL replies with `genai.markdown_table.source_expired`.
- Tables too long for a Discord message go out as a `table.md` attachment instead of being
  truncated; half a table defeats the copy/paste the button exists for.
- The button is disabled when the collector window (`MARKDOWN_TABLE_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS`) closes.
  Webhook-authored messages are edited through the authoring webhook, since the bot token cannot
  edit them.

Delivering the button required `StreamSendPayload.components`, which `StreamUiUpdater` forwards on
all four send paths (webhook, webhook recovery, reply, and channel send).

Stage 05 guarantees the table arrives here as one intact block; see
[`05-buffer-management.md`](05-buffer-management.md) § Markdown table atomicity.

## Chunking behavior (`chunkMessage`)

`chunkMessage()` (`src/utils/text/processors/chunkProcessor.ts`) is the function that converts a
single normalized text segment into one or more Discord-safe messages. It runs as a multi-pass
parser that classifies the input into typed blocks, then emits chunks.

### Preserved spans

The parser locates and protects regions whose internal structure must not be split mid-region.
A chunk break can only happen at the boundary *between* such regions, never inside:

- Fenced code blocks (``` ``` ```): kept whole; split across multiple messages only if a single
  block exceeds the chunk limit, in which case the opening fence + language tag is repeated on
  each subsequent chunk so syntax highlighting survives.
- URLs (matched outside markdown link parens): never split.
- Markdown spans: bold (`**` / `__`), italic (`*` / `_`), strikethrough (`~~`),
  inline code (`` ` ``), and links (`[text](url)`).
- Quoted strings: straight `"..."` and every distinct open/close pair in `PAIRED_QUOTE_MARKS`
  (`「」`, `『』`, `｢｣`, `«»`, `‹›`, `“”`, `〈〉`, `《》`). `'` and `‘’` are excluded because they
  double as apostrophes.
- Balanced parentheses `(...)`.
- Discord custom emoji tags `<:name:id>` and `<a:name:id>`.

### Emoji isolation and runs

By default, every custom emoji block is **isolated**: flushed into its own Discord message rather
than carried inline with surrounding text. Consecutive emojis are merged into a single
"emoji-run" message **iff** their normalized names share the same prefix (length controlled by
`EMOJI_RUN_PREFIX_LENGTH`, default 3; the regex `[^a-z0-9]` strips separators before slicing).
This produces Discord's large-emoji rendering for reaction-style messages, while keeping
unrelated emoji packs in separate messages.

Two carve-outs override the default isolation and fold the emoji inline with adjacent text:

1. **Mid-sentence**: non-emoji text exists on both sides of the emoji on the same `\n`-delimited
   line, AND the text immediately before does not end in sentence-terminating punctuation
   (`. ! ? 。 ！ ？`). Example: `"I really like :Soup:, don't you?"` → one chunk.
2. **List item**: the emoji's line begins with a list marker (`\d+[.)] ` or `- ` / `* ` / `• `).
   Example: `"1. :Soup:\n2. :Smile:"` → list numbering stays attached to each emoji.

Trailing emojis after a completed sentence (`"That was amazing! :Soup:"`) and leading emojis
(`":Soup: looks tasty"`) intentionally remain isolated; the carve-outs target structural
contexts, not stylistic prose.

### Humanizer interaction

`HumanizerDegree` (a `TomoriState.config` field) controls how the resulting blocks emit as
messages after parsing. The value is per-answering-persona: a persona-level override
(`persona_configs.humanizer_degree`, set via `/config` > Engine > General with `scope: Persona`) is
overlaid onto that persona's `config.humanizer_degree` at state-load time, falling back to
the server-wide `server_chat_configs` value when NULL:

| Degree | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `NONE` (0) | Aggregated delivery: chunks join into one message at flush boundaries (see Mission §) |
| `LIGHT` / `MEDIUM` (1-2) | Each paragraph (`\n+`-separated) becomes its own Discord message |
| `HEAVY` (3) | Each sentence becomes its own message; sentence splitting uses an abbreviation-aware regex (`createSentenceSplitRegex`) to avoid breaking on "Mr.", "e.g.", numbered references, etc. `humanizeString()` then runs per sentence and can split it further (see below). |

Standalone-punctuation chunks (a chunk that is purely `.,!?;:。！？、，` after trimming) are
merged into the previous or next chunk by `mergeStandalonePunctuationChunks`, preventing orphan
punctuation messages.

At `HEAVY`, `humanizeString()` lowercases the sentence, strips semicolons (`;`/`；`), and independently rolls
each comma (`,`/`、`/`，`/`､`) between remove / flush / keep and each run of `!`/`?`/`！`/`？` between flush /
keep (marks are never removed). A "flush" strips the comma (the mark stays for `!`/`?`) and splits
the sentence into an additional Discord message, sent through the same typing-simulated path as
the sentence-per-message split above, because `sendSegment()` pushes every returned piece into
`finalMessageChunks` rather than embedding a literal newline. An ASCII `,`/`!`/`?` only rolls when
whitespace or the end of the text follows it, so tokens like `1,000`, `a,b`, `<@!id>`, `!help`,
and `?...` are never stripped or split; full-width `、`/`，`/`！`/`？` have no such requirement because
CJK prose has no spaces. Every rule classifies by character script, never by the user's locale,
because a persona can reply in a language other than the user's preference: lowercasing applies to
every cased script (accented Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) and leaves uncased scripts unchanged, and
sender prefixes and inline code are protected in any script. Any comma/mark inside `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `~~strikethrough~~`,
`||spoiler||`, a `"quoted"` span or any `PAIRED_QUOTE_MARKS` pair, a parenthesized aside, or a
`[markdown link](url)` is also left untouched, so a flush can never sever formatting across two
messages. More messages per reply means a server's `send_message_limit` is reached sooner; that
tradeoff is accepted. Sample dialogues and dialogue-history
reconstruction call the same function; see
[10-sample-dialogues.md](/architecture/pipelines/context-build/02-native-assembly/10-sample-dialogues/).

## Input

- `segment: string`: normalized text from stage 06.
- `boundary: BufferedDeliveryBoundary | undefined`: forwarded from stage 06 for aggregated-mode
  newline joining logic.
- `textConfig: TextProcessingConfig`: `visibleDeliveryMode`, `humanizerDegree`, `maxMessageLength`.
- `typingConfig: TypingSimulationConfig`: speed, duration limits, random-pause config.
- `context: StreamContext`: channel, webhook, locale, tomoriState, progress callback.
- `state: StreamState`: `messageSentCount`, `accumulatedText`, `pendingAggregatedText`,
  `firstReplyUrl`.

## Output

No return value from `sendSegment()`. `sendSinglePayload()` returns `Promise<Message | null>`:
the sent Discord `Message` object (used by `sendRenderedMarkdownTable` to cache table content by
message ID), or `null` if the send was skipped (stop request, limit reached, empty content).

## Side effects

- **Discord message sent**: the primary side effect; one or more Discord messages are created in
  `context.channel` (or via `context.webhook`).
- **Post-turn sticker sent**: when a completed tool loop selects a sticker,
  `postTurnEffects.ts` appends a webhook sticker URL or native Discord sticker
  after text delivery; this is intentionally outside stream message counts.
- **`state.messageSentCount`**: incremented per message sent.
- **`state.accumulatedText`**: appended with the text of each sent message (used for STM write
  at pipeline end). Render-modifier sends append the visible `SourcePersona (modifier): ` label once
  at the start of the modified line, even when the line is split across multiple Discord messages.
- **`state.firstReplyUrl`**: set to the URL of the first reply message (if not already set).
- **`state.hasRepliedToOriginalMessage`**: set to `true` after the first successful reply.
- **`state.pendingAggregatedText`**: cleared after an aggregated-mode flush.
- **`context.replyNoticeState`**: `attempted` and `sent` flags updated when the alter reply
  notice is sent.
- **Webhook cache invalidation**: on invalid-webhook error: `invalidateWebhookCache(channelId)`
  is called and a new webhook is fetched.
- **`context.onStreamProgress?.()` callback**: called on each successful send.

## Invariants

After this stage (per successful send):

- `state.accumulatedText` contains all text that has been delivered to Discord so far in this
  stream.
- `state.messageSentCount` reflects the total number of Discord messages sent.
- If a stop request was detected before or during a typing delay, no further sends occur and the
  method returns early.

## Extension points

| Surface | Plugin-relevance |
|---|---|
| `sendWebhookMessageWithIdentity()` | `src/utils/discord/webhook/personaDispatch.ts`. The webhook persona dispatch path is the extension seam for persona-specific message appearance. A plugin adding a new persona display mode (e.g., custom embed layout) would extend here. → plugin plan candidate |
| `chunkMessage()` | `src/utils/text/processors/chunkProcessor.ts`. Internal: message chunking is tightly coupled to Discord's 2000-character limit and the humanizer sentence-split regex. |
| `humanizeString()` | `src/utils/text/processors/formatters.ts`. Internal: degree-3 humanization is a randomized comma/emphasis noise function that can split a sentence into extra messages; no plugin-relevant seam. |
| Typing simulation (`sendChunksWithTyping`, `interruptibleDelay`) | Internal: typing simulation timing constants are configurable via `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS`; the `HumanizerDegree` DB field is the user-facing control. |
| `STREAMING_LIMITS.MAX_FLUSH_COUNT` | `src/utils/security/rateLimiter.ts`. Internal: an operational safety cap, not a plugin seam. The server-configured `send_message_limit` is the user-facing control. |
| Aggregated-mode buffer (`pendingAggregatedText`, `flushAggregatedTextBuffer`) | Internal: aggregated delivery is driven by `HumanizerDegree.NONE`; not designed for external control. |
| `StreamSendPayload.components` | `src/utils/discord/stream/uiUpdater.ts`. The seam for attaching interactive rows to a streamed message; currently only the rendered table's "Show Markdown" button uses it. A plugin adding message-level controls would extend here. → plugin plan candidate |

## Configuration

| Source | Key / Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TomoriState.config` | `humanizer_degree` | `MEDIUM` | Controls delivery mode (aggregated vs. streaming) and typing simulation |
| `TomoriState.config` | `send_message_limit` | `0` (no limit) | Per-stream Discord message cap; `0` means unlimited |
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `BASE_TYPE_SPEED_MS_PER_CHAR` | `10` ms | Typing speed multiplier per character |
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `MAX_TYPING_TIME_MS` | `4 000` ms | Cap on typing delay per chunk |
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `MIN_VISIBLE_TYPING_DURATION_MS` | `750` ms | Minimum typing delay shown |
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `THINKING_PAUSE_CHANCE` | `0.25` | Probability of an extra "thinking" pause between chunks |
| `DISCORD_STREAMING_CONSTANTS` | `MIN_RANDOM_PAUSE_MS` / `MAX_RANDOM_PAUSE_MS` | `250` / `1500` ms | Thinking pause duration range |
| `STREAMING_LIMITS.MAX_FLUSH_COUNT` | `src/utils/security/rateLimiter.ts` | `40` | Absolute safety cap on messages per stream; a HEAVY-degree reply with many commas/emphasis marks reaches this sooner than a plain sentence-per-message split would |
| Env var | `HUMANIZER_COMMA_REMOVE_PROBABILITY` | `0.4` | Chance each comma is deleted outright (HEAVY only) |
| Env var | `HUMANIZER_COMMA_FLUSH_PROBABILITY` | `0.2` | Chance each comma instead splits into a new message (HEAVY only) |
| Env var | `HUMANIZER_EMPHASIS_FLUSH_PROBABILITY` | `0.5` | Chance each `!`/`?`/`！`/`？` run splits into a new message right after it (HEAVY only) |
| Env var | `MARKDOWN_TABLE_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS` | `7 200 000` ms (2 h) | How long a rendered table's "Show Markdown" button stays interactive; matches the `MARKDOWN_TABLE_CACHE_TTL_MINUTES` default so the button never outlives its cached source |
