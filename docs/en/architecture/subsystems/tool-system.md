title: "Tool System"

TomoriBot exposes built-in `BaseTool` classes through `src/tools/toolRegistry.ts` and MCP functions through provider adapters. Centralized availability logic lives in `src/tools/availability.ts`; it applies provider checks, model capability checks, feature flags, guild MCP collision rules, and deliberate-tool allowlists before tools are sent to the LLM.

## Dynamic Tool Assembly

After availability filtering and before provider adapter serialization, built-in tools pass through `src/tools/assembly.ts`. Most tools are returned unchanged. Capability-sensitive tools can implement `assembleForContext(context)` to return a per-turn variant with a narrower `description`, `parameters`, or enum set, or `null` to hide the tool when no concrete backend is available.

Current dynamic schema users:

- `web_search` exposes only categories supported by the active search backend: SearXNG gets all categories, Brave gets text/image/video/news, and DuckDuckGo/IAsk MCP fallback gets text-only.
- `generate_image` exposes only the modes supported by the configured standard image backend: text-to-image, image-to-image/reference fields, and ComfyUI inpaint/outpaint controls are pruned independently. The descriptions of the parameters that survive pruning are also trimmed to the supported modes: `prompt` only appends inpaint/outpaint guidance when those modes exist, and `media_id`/`denoise` only name the reference modes (img2img/inpaint/outpaint) the backend can actually run, so a text-to-image-only backend never sees dead-weight edit-mode instructions. It injects server default positive image tags as prompt guidance, and passes default negative tags only when the custom image endpoint declares `workflow_supports.negative_prompt` support. ComfyUI image endpoints default that checkbox on; generic custom image endpoints default it off.
- `generate_voice_message` exposes script markup and optional `voice_instructions` based on the active speech endpoint and persona voice-design state. It shares its synthesis dispatcher and delivery path with `/generate voice-message`, so the two callers cannot drift; see [Voice System](../integrations/voice/) for the source-resolution table and the Discord delivery quirks.

Runtime validation remains required. Assembly prevents the LLM from seeing unsupported options, while execution-time checks still guard stale config, backend health changes, and manually crafted tool calls.

Image generation progress notices are also backend-aware. They only announce default negative tags when a negative-prompt channel is active, always include the image-tags setup hint, list saved user/persona image tags detected in the current context, and call out avatar references separately from message image references.

## Participant-backed targets

Participant-aware tools resolve users and personas from the `ParticipantTargetIndex` attached
to the prepared participant context item. The index is built from typed identities and
purpose-filtered aliases; tools do not reconstruct targets from prompt text, transport maps,
or display-name joins. Existing `conversationUsers` metadata is a projection of the same
index, so tool targets, streamed mentions, tool-reply mentions, and copied identities retain
one collision policy and primary-name tie-break behavior.

`analyze_image` resolves images from the requested Discord message first. If that message is a text-only reply, it falls back one level to the directly referenced message so it can analyze the image being discussed. The tool also applies the configurable `VISION_ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_MS` deadline (default 60 seconds) across image downloads and vision-provider inference so a stalled vision request returns a failed tool result before the outer chat timeout.

## Persona User Blocking

`block_user` and `unblock_user` are built-in Discord tools gated by `user_blocking_enabled` in `/config` > Permissions. They write to `persona_user_blocks`, scoped to the active persona rather than the whole server.

`mute` blocks only trigger eligibility for that persona. `block` replaces the target user's recent live dialogue-history turns and direct media during context building with a single `[System: ... sent a message but is currently blocked by you for N more hour(s). Use \`unblock_user\` to unblock if needed]` notice (consecutive messages from the same blocked user collapse into one notice), and suppresses reply annotations that would quote those messages. The notice is an LLM-facing system injection (English, not localized), mirroring reminder/join injections. `block` does not remove memories, reminders, documents, short-term memory summaries, or generic references from other users.

## Unified Web Tools

`web_search` is the LLM-visible web search surface. Its dispatcher routes through internal engines and keeps engine-specific tool names hidden. The assembled schema guarantees the category enum for the current turn, so the tool description should not use fail-first language such as "this category may be unavailable" for advertised enum values.

`fetch_url` is the LLM-visible URL-reading surface. It validates the requested target before dispatch and, in production, blocks localhost/private/internal/reserved URLs unless `FETCH_URL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true`. Outside production (`RUN_ENV` != `production`) this guard auto-relaxes so local development can reach private endpoints with no configuration, mirroring the production-gated model of `validateRemoteUrl`. Cloud instance-metadata and link-local addresses (`169.254.0.0/16`, IPv6 link-local, AWS IPv6 IMDS) are additionally blocked by an always-on denylist (`src/utils/security/cloudMetadata.ts`) that neither the dev auto-relax nor the opt-in can bypass; it runs in both this pre-dispatch gate and the `validateRemoteUrl` connection/redirect gate. The localized failure message names the `FETCH_URL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true` opt-in so TomoriBot can explain why a production fetch failed. The mandatory `safe_http` engine performs DNS validation and pinning, manually follows a bounded number of redirects, revalidates every hop, and limits the downloaded byte count before converting HTML to Markdown. The legacy `mcp_fetch` engine name is accepted as an alias for `safe_http`, but network fetching is no longer delegated to the Python MCP process. Crawl4AI may be listed in `FETCH_URL_ENGINE_ORDER` but is only admitted where private-network fetching is permitted: any non-production runtime, or production with an explicit `FETCH_URL_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true` opt-in; it is never part of the secure production default chain.

The obsolete `mcp-server-fetch` startup and installation path was removed after this migration. This prevents an unused Python process from failing independently and ensures the required fallback always stays inside the per-hop URL validation boundary.

Successful `safe_http` results place the formatted URL and Markdown in `ToolResult.data.summary`, because the streaming tool loop serializes successful `data` into provider history. OpenAI-compatible builders emit that function response once as a `tool` message; they add a synthetic `user` message only when image metadata needs a user-role carrier.

## Guild MCP Replacements

Remote registrations are managed primarily through the ephemeral Components V2 `/config` > Plugins
> MCP Servers collection panel.
The panel reloads durable configuration on every global interaction, addresses writes by
`guild_mcp_id` within the current workspace, and reports configured Enabled/Disabled state rather
than live health. Add still validates the URL and tests a temporary connection before the encrypted
registration is saved. Disable and Remove retain database write, post-success cache invalidation,
then pooled-connection disconnect ordering. Every mutation runs through the canonical operations in
`src/utils/mcp/mcpConfigOperations.ts`.
The panel renders the complete supported collection in deterministic order. Each row is a compact
name-and-safe-endpoint bullet followed by a localized configured-state/type blockquote, then its
Enable/Disable and Remove actions; authentication presence is not displayed. It opens Add directly as one raw modal with Name,
URL, optional Auth Token, and required General Purpose/Web Search/URL Fetcher type selection; General
Purpose is selected by default and persists as `null`. Healthy views have no refresh control; stale or
unavailable configuration reads expose read-only Retry, which reloads stored rows without connecting to
an endpoint. Mutation receipts occupy a separate Components V2 container beside the authoritative
repainted collection; Add receipts may include a bounded list of sanitized discovered tool names, with
each name formatted separately as inline code.

Each registration persists `last_discovered_tool_names` as a bounded display-only snapshot. `NULL`
means discovery is unknown, including legacy rows; an empty array records a successful zero-tool
discovery. The Add connection test writes its normalized result in the same registration INSERT. After a
later lazy connection completes `listTools()`, `GuildMcpManager` best-effort refreshes the snapshot by
stable `(server_id, guild_mcp_id)` identity in a detached task, so connection availability never waits for
display metadata persistence. An unchanged snapshot performs no write, a successful update invalidates
only the guild MCP configuration cache, and a failed update leaves the live connection and prior snapshot
intact. Live `listTools()` output remains authoritative for routing and invocation; the panel never
connects remotely to render this metadata. Snapshot retention defaults to 100 names and 128 Unicode
characters per name, configurable with `MCP_TOOL_SNAPSHOT_MAX_NAMES` and
`MCP_TOOL_SNAPSHOT_NAME_MAX_CHARS`.

Guild MCP tools are appended after built-in and global MCP filtering, then collision-checked. If a guild enables a `url_fetcher` MCP server with at least one function, TomoriBot hides bundled `fetch_url` for that guild so the LLM receives one URL-fetch surface. Prompt macro resolution follows the same rule: `{url_fetch_tool}` prefers guild `url_fetcher` functions, then falls back to `fetch_url`.

The `tool_family:url_fetch` prompt predicate follows the same family resolution. Under
Deliberate Tool Mode, a URL-reading intent admits the guild replacement function names as
well as the bundled aliases, so replacing `fetch_url` does not make documentation guidance
disappear from the prompt.

## Capability Self-Diagnosis

`review_capabilities` builds its chat and settings inventories from `ToolRegistry` runtime
availability instead of maintaining a second hardcoded tool list. Its command report formats
the cached `loadCommandData()` registration payload, which is the same payload registered
with Discord and includes root, flat, and grouped commands.

Chat and command reports are safe for normal members. The settings report exposes feature
states and disabled reasons to everyone, but credential state, rotation-pool counts, internal
identifiers, and system-prompt metadata require the requesting Discord member to hold
`ManageGuild`. A missing member context fails closed and receives the redacted report.

Self-diagnostic intent includes questions about the active model, tools, settings, supported
features, and why TomoriBot did not or cannot perform an action. These turns admit both
`review_capabilities` and URL-reading tools: runtime state is checked first, then the model may
consult the curated official docs when the runtime report is insufficient.

### Connection resilience

Guild MCP servers are connected lazily and pooled (`guildMcpManager`), on the critical path of tool-gathering before each generation. Each connect attempt tries transports in order (Smithery Connect (for `*.run.tools`), then StreamableHTTP, then SSE) using a **fresh MCP client per attempt** (reusing one client across attempts triggers the SDK's "Already connected to a transport" error and breaks the fallback). Every attempt is bounded by `GUILD_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`.

A **circuit breaker** quarantines any server that fails to connect for `GUILD_MCP_FAILURE_COOLDOWN_MS` (default 5 min), so a single unreachable server cannot re-pay its full connect timeout on every generation (and every fallback-model attempt), which would otherwise blow the stream inactivity budget and stall chat for that guild. The quarantine is cleared early on a successful connect or when the server is removed/disabled.

## NovelAI

`fetch_url` is not exposed to NovelAI initially. NovelAI GLM tool calling is prompt-based and token-constrained, and fetched-page payloads need separate prompt-budget validation before enabling this tool.
