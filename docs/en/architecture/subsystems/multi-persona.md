title: "Multi-Persona System"
---

This document describes TomoriBot's multi-persona system: how main and alter personas are stored, triggered, and rendered (webhooks, embeds, stickers, reminders), plus operational details and limitations.

## Overview

TomoriBot supports **one main persona** plus **multiple alter personas** per server.

- **Main persona**: the default identity; responds to mentions, direct replies, and auto-message triggers.
- **Alter personas**: optional additional identities with their own trigger words and (optional) custom avatars.
- **Shared context**: all personas share the same conversation history and server memories.
- **Shared config**: all personas in a server share the same server-scoped config tables (`server_*_configs`).
- **Sequential responses**: if multiple personas match a trigger, they respond one-by-one via the channel queue.

Official bundled character presets have their own pointer behavior for seeded text, sprites, and avatars. Pointer alters live-resolve a shared preset avatar; the main persona's guild avatar is fanned out by a hash-gated background reconciler. See [Persona Presets](/architecture/subsystems/persona-presets/).

### Participant context freshness

Persona responses in the same locked chat turn share only active-independent participant
discovery. The request scope freezes the sanitized visible history, participant identities,
persona catalog, and responder set, so equivalent turns avoid repeating the candidate query
and reference-membership checks. Each persona still gets a newly composed active identity
and public-profile view, followed by fresh member, privacy, blacklist, lineage-memory,
persona-reminder, and self-task hydration. No prepared participant result is reused across
locked chat turns.

## Data Model

### `personas`

Each persona is a row in `personas`.

Key columns:
- `is_alter`: `false` for main, `true` for alters.
- `webhook_avatar_url`: stored alter avatar reference.
  - Production: stable public URL (S3 / CloudFront).
  - Non-production: stable local path under `data/avatars/...`, or a legacy HTTP URL until lazy migration runs.
  - **NULL for an unforked preset-pointer alter**: it live-resolves the shared `persona_presets.preset_avatar_shared_url` into its cached state at load time, so one image is shared across servers and catalog avatar edits fan out on reseed (see [Persona Presets](/architecture/subsystems/persona-presets/) → *Avatar syncing*).
- `applied_avatar_hash`: for a main preset-pointer persona, the `preset_avatar_hash` last PATCHed onto this guild's member avatar by the fan-out reconciler. NULL = never synced.

### `persona_configs`

Per-persona configuration (one row per persona in `personas`):
- `trigger_words`: trigger words for this persona (**all personas use this column**; Phase 6 F1 merged the former `personas.alter_triggers` column here; the old `is_alter ? alter_triggers : trigger_words` ternary is gone).
- `humanizer_degree` (nullable, migration `047`): per-persona humanizer override set via `/config` > Engine > General with `scope: Persona`. NULL inherits the server-wide `server_chat_configs.humanizer_degree`. When set, persona state loading overlays the value onto that persona's assembled `config.humanizer_degree`, so providers, the stream buffer, and HEAVY-degree context transforms all see the persona-scoped degree with no call-site awareness. Like the persona LLM override (and unlike content edits), setting it does **not** materialize a preset-pointer persona.

### `persona_sprites`

Default (preset-pointer) personas can ship with an **official sprite set** that resolves live from the shared `preset_sprites` table, so every server's pointer persona gets them with no per-server storage. `PersonaSpriteRepository.listForPersona()` resolves preset sprites for pointer personas and own-rows for materialized ones, so everything below applies uniformly. See [persona-presets](../subsystems/persona-presets) → *`preset_sprites`*.

`persona_sprites` stores named per-persona avatar variants selected by generated render-modifier labels:

- `sprite_name`: display label shown in prompt guidance and webhook names, e.g. `mad`.
- `sprite_key`: normalized lookup key for case/spacing-insensitive matching.
- `avatar_url`: production public object URL, or a non-production local path under `data/avatars/servers/{serverDiscId}/personas/{personaId}/sprites/{assetId}.png`.
- `usage_instructions`: short guidance injected into the active persona's prompt so the model knows when the sprite should be used.
- `is_identity`: when `true`, the sprite renders its **decorated** `sprite_name (SourcePersona)` name directly in Discord (DID alter / "system member" style) instead of the clean persona name. Set via the **Save as Identity** checkbox on the Add and Edit modals of `/config` > Persona > Sprites (default unchecked on add). The checkbox is authoritative on every save; saving an existing sprite with the box unchecked demotes it back to an ordinary sprite.

Sprite rows are managed by the add, edit, and remove actions on `/config` > Persona > Sprites. Reusing a sprite name on `add` replaces the existing row and image. `edit` changes a sprite's name, optional replacement image, usage instructions, and `is_identity` flag in place; image replacements consume the same shared avatar quota as `add`, while metadata-only edits stay quota-free. Renaming updates `sprite_key` and is rejected if it would collide with another sprite on the same persona. The default per-persona limit is 50 (`PERSONA_SPRITE_MAX_PER_PERSONA`), and the prompt only lists the first 20 by default (`PERSONA_SPRITE_PROMPT_MAX_COUNT`). Identity status is not surfaced to the model; invocation syntax is identical for both kinds, so only the rendered webhook name differs.

#### Sprite export / import (`.zip`)

A persona's whole sprite set can be shared as a `.zip` via the export and import actions on `/config` > Persona > Sprites. This is kept separate from `/persona export` (which carries only the persona card) so sprite images do not balloon the card file. The archive format lives in `src/utils/persona/spriteArchive.ts`:

- **Layout:** `manifest.json` (format `version`, `source_persona` info, and a per-sprite list of `sprite_name` / `sprite_key` / `usage_instructions` / `is_identity` / `file`) plus the images under `sprites/NN-{key}.png`. Storage references and DB ids are deliberately excluded: they are meaningless on another server.
- **Export** (`export.ts`): a persona-select modal; the command loads each sprite's stored image, normalizes it to PNG, and bundles them. Sprites whose image can no longer be loaded are skipped and the result is reported as partial. The reply is public (for sharing), like `/persona export`.
- **Import** (`import.ts`): a single modal (persona string-select plus a `.zip` file-upload field) mirroring `/config` > Persona > Sprites. Requires a guild and Manage Server. The whole batch reserves **one** import-operation quota slot (not one avatar-quota slot per sprite). Names are re-validated and every image is re-converted to PNG **before** any storage/DB write, so a bad entry aborts cleanly. Name conflicts **overwrite** the existing sprite (old image is deleted from storage). If the archive would push the persona past `PERSONA_SPRITE_MAX_PER_PERSONA`, the **entire import is rejected** (all-or-nothing); only new keys count toward the cap, since same-key entries are overwrites. Untrusted archives are guarded against ZIP bombs by entry-count, per-file, and total-decompressed caps.

### `reminders`

Reminders are tied to a persona to preserve the identity that set them:
- `persona_id` (nullable): the persona's `persona_id` that created the reminder.
- When missing or invalid, reminders **fall back to the main persona**.

## Triggering and Routing

### Direct replies and mentions

- **Reply to bot** (main persona messages) → main persona responds.
- **Reply to alter webhook message** → the matching alter responds.
  - Matching is done by webhook `author.username` → persona nickname (case-insensitive).
  - Copied-render webhook names like `Ren (Obonya)` route replies back to the source persona
    (`Ren`) while preserving the full visible label in prompt history.
  - Ensure persona nicknames are unique.
- **Bot mention** → main persona responds.
- Direct replies and bot mentions can combine with explicit persona trigger words in the same message. For example, replying to Tomori while mentioning `@Ren` routes the turn to Tomori and Ren.
- Persona-authored output can intentionally cascade to another persona by emitting that persona's `@trigger`. During output cleanup, known persona nicknames and trigger names are preserved as deliberate trigger text instead of being stripped as unresolved Discord user mentions. The common model variants `@{Name}`, `@(Name)`, and `@[Name]` are canonicalized to bare `@trigger`. Real Discord user mentions still resolve first.
- **Auto-message threshold** → main persona responds.

### Trigger words

Each persona checks its own trigger list in `persona_configs.trigger_words`. The former split (`tomori_configs.trigger_words` for main, `personas.alter_triggers` for alters) was unified in Phase 6 F1.

If multiple personas match, they respond in deterministic order based on where their trigger first appears in the message. The per-message count is capped by `/config` > Engine > Trigger.

#### Single-owner trigger resolution

Every official preset deliberately bundles the shared base word (`tomori`) alongside its unique name; e.g. the *shy* preset ships `[tomori, lilya]`. Pointer personas resolve their triggers live from that shared preset, so without de-duplication the same word (`tomori`) would route to the main persona **and** every alter at once.

To prevent this, `PersonaRepository.loadAllForServer` collapses trigger words to a single owner every time it assembles a server's persona set (`applyTriggerWordOwnership`). Ownership is awarded by priority:

1. **Main persona(s)** (`is_alter = false`) are never trimmed. They reserve the locale's base trigger words from `general.defaults.base_trigger_words` even if their stored list omits them, so an alter cannot steal the bot's own name. The global `BASE_TRIGGER_WORDS` setting still applies to chat trigger detection.
2. **Alters in creation order** (ascending `persona_id`): the first-created alter wins a contested word; later personas drop it.

A persona keeps only the words no higher-priority persona already owns. Two identical alters (e.g. two *Default* alters, each `[tomori, rose]`) therefore resolve to: main owns `tomori`, the older alter owns `rose`, and the newer alter ends up with **no addressable trigger** (reachable only by @mention, reply, or its webhook identity).

Because this runs at read time, it self-heals existing servers and covers **every** write path: `/persona default`, `/persona import`, pointer materialization, and preset auto-sync. The creation commands (`/persona default`, `importAlterPreset`) also apply the same de-dup when computing the success-message trigger summary, so what they report matches what the loader will route. Note that for pointer personas, `persona_configs.trigger_words` is **not** the live source (the preset is); it stores the de-duped set for honest display and for the case the pointer is later materialized/forked.

### Follow-up behavior during active streaming

When a persona is mid-stream and a new message arrives, TomoriBot checks whether the message carries an explicit trigger for a **different** persona before deciding to treat it as a follow-up:

- **Explicit cross-persona trigger detected** (any of the three signals below) → the message is **not** treated as a follow-up. It queues as a normal busy-channel message and routes to the correct persona once the current turn ends.
- **No cross-persona trigger** → the message becomes a follow-up interrupt, continuing with the active persona.

The three explicit-trigger signals that cause this bypass:

| Signal | Target persona |
|---|---|
| Trigger word match | The persona whose `trigger_words` matched |
| `@Bot` mention or reply to a bot message | Main persona |
| Reply to a webhook persona message | The persona whose nickname matches the webhook author |

This ensures that explicitly addressing Persona A mid-stream never causes Persona B to respond again instead.

### Manual triggers

Manual triggers can specify `selectedPersonaId`. In that case, **only that persona responds** (fallbacks apply if missing).

`/respond` resolves its implicit persona from recent channel history before falling back:
1. the last known Tomori persona that spoke in the channel;
2. the user's personal spotlight auto-trigger persona, if configured and allowed;
3. the channel's `/config` > Channels > Auto-Trigger persona assignment, if configured;
4. the main persona.

Configured join welcomes also use the manual-trigger path:
- `/config` > Channels > Logs & Welcome stores a selected persona or `Random`.
- On `guildMemberAdd`, the welcome event resolves that persona and calls `tomoriChat(..., isManuallyTriggered = true, selectedPersonaId = ...)`.
- If `welcome_persona_id` is `NULL`, one persona is chosen uniformly from the server's available personas for that join.

Configured auto-trigger channels can also pin a single persona per channel:
- `/config` > Channels > Auto-Trigger can enable/disable channels in bulk, or target one channel and choose which persona should answer there.
- The per-channel assignment is stored in `server_auto_trigger_persona_overrides`; the assembled config still exposes it as `autoch_persona_overrides`.
- If a channel has no explicit assignment, auto-trigger falls back to the main persona.

### Copied Rendering Syntax

An active persona can intentionally render one generated line with a sprite avatar, or as a known copied user/persona, by
starting the line as:

```text
SourcePersona (target): message
```

Resolution order is:

1. **Persona sprite** on the active source persona. A matching `persona_sprites.sprite_key` sends the line through the managed webhook with the sprite image. The username depends on the sprite's `is_identity` flag:
   - **Ordinary sprite** (`is_identity = false`): the **clean username `SourcePersona`**; the `(sprite)` suffix is not shown in Discord. The message → sprite-label mapping is persisted to `persona_sprite_messages` so context rebuilding can recover the decorated `SourcePersona (sprite):` label for the model. Because Discord groups consecutive webhook messages by `webhook_id` + `username` (ignoring the per-message avatar) **and strips zero-width/blank characters from usernames**, back-to-back ordinary sprites that share the clean name would otherwise all render under the *first* sprite's avatar, and no invisible marker can break that. To prevent it, when a sprite change would collide with the previous message's clean name, that one follow-up message falls back to the decorated `SourcePersona (sprite)` username (so it reads as a distinct Discord author and its avatar renders); the clean name is kept otherwise. A parity toggle flipped on each sprite change (`StreamState.spriteGroupParity` / `lastDeliveredSpriteKey`) drives this, so adjacent different-sprite messages alternate clean/decorated and never match, while same-sprite runs keep an identical username and still group. The decorated fallback round-trips through `resolveRenderModifierSourcePersona` for attribution, exactly like an identity sprite.
   - **Identity sprite** (`is_identity = true`): the **flipped username `sprite (SourcePersona)`** is shown directly in Discord, like a copied identity / DID alter. No mapping lookup is needed for recovery; the decorated name re-attributes to the source persona through `resolveRenderModifierSourcePersona` (the persona nickname sits in the parens), and the message → sprite-label mapping is still persisted as a fallback.

   In both cases the model-facing context label stays `SourcePersona (sprite)`. If the sprite row matches but the stored image is missing/unusable, TomoriBot strips the prefix and sends the text as normal source-persona output; it does not fall through to copied identity.
2. **Copied identity** if no sprite matched. `target` resolves only against known personas in the server and Discord users already present in conversation context. If exactly one target matches, TomoriBot uses the **flipped** username `target (SourcePersona)` and the target's avatar; the impersonated name leads so the disguise reads naturally in chat, while the model-facing context label stays `SourcePersona (target)` so the LLM never confuses who is speaking.
3. **Plain output** when no sprite/copy target resolves, or copied identity is ambiguous. The parenthetical modifier is stripped before delivery.

Copied user and persona matching consumes the same hidden `ParticipantTargetIndex` used by
stream mentions and tool targets. User candidates are limited to hydrated conversation
participants and the `copied_identity` alias purpose. The request's complete persona alias
catalog is merged into that index without making every persona a rendered participant or a
tool-user target.

`/impersonate persona` accepts the same sprite grammar in its `message` option, resolved directly against `persona_sprites` rather than through the stream pipeline (`parseLeadingImpersonationSpriteModifier` in `renderModifierParser.ts`). Because the `persona` autocomplete option already fixes the persona, the source name is optional there: both `Tomori (shocked): message` and the bare `(shocked): message` match, provided `shocked` is an actual `sprite_key` on the selected persona. A match resolves the sprite's avatar with the shared `resolveSpriteIdentity` helper, strips the modifier prefix, and sends through the managed webhook (forcing the webhook path even for the main, non-alter persona, since only a webhook send carries a per-message avatar override) with the same `persona_sprite_messages` bookkeeping as a normal streamed sprite. When the modifier does not match a real sprite, the text is sent exactly as typed, parentheses included; copied-identity resolution does not apply to this command.

Attribution, quota, self-reply bookkeeping, STM ownership, and reply routing remain attached to `SourcePersona`. History reconstruction (`resolveRenderModifierSourcePersona`) accepts both webhook-name orientations: flipped copied identities like `Obonya (Ren)` (persona inside the parens, current format) and legacy `Ren (Obonya)` decorations, always rebuilding the source-first `Ren (Obonya)` label for prompt history. When *both* parts match personas (persona impersonating another persona), the flipped interpretation wins; legacy persona-on-persona messages are misattributed until they age out of the fetch window. Sprite messages are visually identical to plain `Ren` messages in Discord; their decorated prompt label is recovered from the `persona_sprite_messages` mapping (cache-primed per context build), and a missing mapping degrades to the plain persona name.

### Personal spotlight

Users can add a channel-scoped personal persona filter with `/personal config`:

- The spotlight stores a per-user allowed persona set for one channel.
- That set is intersected with the server whitelist result, so personal spotlight can only narrow access, never expand it.
- If the spotlight also chooses an auto-trigger persona, that persona becomes the user+channel-scoped fallback for every qualifying message from that user in that channel.
- `/personal config` removes permanent or timed spotlight rows.

## Response Pipeline (Multi-Persona)

High-level flow (per incoming message):

1. Identify matching personas.
2. Queue additional personas to ensure sequential replies.
3. For each persona:
   - Build context from shared history.
   - Add participant profiles for other personas that spoke in history, are
     responding to the same original trigger, or are referenced by trigger text
     anywhere in the visible fetched window.
   - Use isolated function-call history per persona.
   - Stream response with persona-specific webhook settings if applicable.

Each profile combines the persona's public attributes and normalized Physical
Appearance tags in the existing "users in conversation" entry. Tags-only
personas are included, and text-only references create a non-mentionable
synthetic persona entry. Private attributes remain visible only to their owning
persona.

Text reference matching deliberately uses normal trigger semantics even while
Deliberate Trigger Mode is enabled. This is context enrichment only:
`triggeredPersonaIds` still comes from routing, so a plain trigger reference
does not schedule that persona to respond. Profiles deduplicate the active
persona, historical speakers, and co-responders. Later queued personas still
do **not** see earlier persona responses in their context (deferred for future
refactor).

## Self-Reply Trigger System

To prevent infinite loops and unbounded persona activations, TomoriBot implements a **cascade trigger limit** that controls how many persona triggers can occur after the first one in a session.

### Overview

- **Default limit**: 3 (configurable via `/config` > Engine > Trigger, max 10)
- **Scope**: Per-channel (shared across all personas)
- **Purpose**: Limit the total number of persona activations after the first trigger in a session
- **Origin tracking**: each trigger session keeps the originating user identity so downstream persona self-messages still respect that user’s server whitelist and personal spotlight restrictions

### Mental Model: Trigger Counter

Think of the trigger counter as a budget of additional activations after the first (free) trigger:

```javascript
// With cascadeLimit = 3
const triggerBudget = {
  triggerCount: 0,     // Starts at 0 when user sends a message
  // First trigger:  count 0 → 1  (free, always allowed)
  // Second trigger: count 1 → 2  (1st additional)
  // Third trigger:  count 2 → 3  (2nd additional)
  // Fourth trigger: count 3 → 4  (3rd additional)
  // Fifth trigger:  count 4 → BLOCKED (exceeds limit of 3 additional)
};
```

**Key concepts:**
- The **first trigger** in a session is always free (doesn’t count against the limit)
- Each **additional trigger** increments the counter, whether from multi-persona or chains
- **trigger-cascade-limit = N** means N additional triggers are allowed after the first (N+1 total)
- **Interaction with trigger-match-limit**: the effective max per message is `min(trigger-match-limit, trigger-cascade-limit + 1)`

### How It Works

#### **Trigger Counting**

Every automatic persona activation (not manually triggered) increments the trigger counter:

- **Multi-persona triggers**: User message triggers Alice, Bob, Charlie → Alice is #1 (free), Bob is #2 (additional), Charlie is #3 (additional)
- **Chain triggers**: Alice’s response triggers Dave → Dave counts as an additional trigger
- Both share the same counter for the session
- In deliberate trigger mode, a persona chain must emit a deliberate form such as `@Dave`; plain `Dave` is still ignored. The output cleaner preserves known persona-directed `@trigger` text so this works for model-authored messages and `interact_with_recent_message` replies.

#### **Bypass (No Limit Applied)**

These triggers do NOT increment the counter:

✅ **Slash commands** (`/respond`, `/impersonate`) → `isManuallyTriggered = true`
✅ **Reminders** → Special flags
✅ **Stop responses** → `isStopResponse = true`

#### **Example with limit = 1**

```
User: "@A, @B, @C"       → trigger-match-limit = 3, trigger-cascade-limit = 1
└─ A responds             → triggerCount: 0 → 1 (first, free)
└─ B responds             → triggerCount: 1 → 2 (1 additional, within limit)
└─ C BLOCKED ❌           → would be triggerCount 3, exceeds limit of 1+1=2
```

**Example with limit = 3:**
```
User: "@A"                          → triggerCount: 0 → 1 (first)
  A: "@B, @C"                       → triggerCount: 1 → 2 (B queued), 2 → 3 (C queued)
  B: "@D"                           → triggerCount: 3 → 4 (D responds, limit reached!)
  C: "@E"                           → triggerCount 4, exceeds limit → BLOCKED ❌
```

### Trigger Session Reset

The trigger counter resets to 0 when:

1. **User sends a message** → Immediate reset (starts a new session)
2. **30 minutes of inactivity** → Automatic reset (`SELF_REPLY_CHAIN_TTL_MS`)

**Exception:** if the active user sends a natural-language stop message while a generation is already running, TomoriBot preserves the current trigger count and clears queued cascade work for that session instead of resetting it.

Auto-trigger note: auto-chat / always-reply channel behavior only qualifies on real user-like messages. Persona self-messages do not advance the shared auto-chat counter and do not auto-trigger fresh self turns by themselves. When a channel has an auto-trigger persona assignment, that persona owns the auto-trigger fallback for that channel; explicit trigger-word matches still take priority. Personal spotlight auto-trigger behaves the same way, but only for the spotlight owner in that specific channel.
With deliberate trigger mode enabled, only deliberate trigger invocations count as explicit matches. Plain trigger words no longer override the channel fallback persona unless that persona is the channel’s exempt auto-chat owner.

Proxy-trigger note: if user A is restricted to persona Alice by either server whitelist or personal spotlight, then `Alice -> Bob` self-trigger chains are blocked for that user. Replies, mentions, and other proxy paths do not bypass the originating user’s persona access rules.

### Configuration

**Database:** `server_chat_configs.cascade_limit`
- Default: 3
- Range: 0 to 10
- 0 = Only the first triggered persona responds, no additional triggers allowed
- N = N additional triggers allowed after the first (N+1 total per session)

**Command:** `/config` > Engine > Trigger

**Database:** `server_chat_configs.match_limit`
- Default: 3
- Range: 1 to 10
- Caps how many personas one message can trigger

**Command:** `/config` > Engine > Trigger

### Example Flow

**Setup:** trigger-cascade-limit = 3, trigger-match-limit = 5, Personas A, B, C, D, E

```
Trigger 1: User: "@A, @B"
           └─ triggerCount: 0 → 1 (A, first/free)
           └─ triggerCount: 1 → 2 (B, 1st additional)

Trigger 2: A: "Ask @C!"
           └─ triggerCount: 2 → 3 (C, 2nd additional)

Trigger 3: B: "Yeah, ask @D too!"
           └─ triggerCount: 3 → 4 (D, 3rd additional, limit reached!)

Trigger 4: C: "Maybe @E?"
           └─ triggerCount = 4, exceeds limit → BLOCKED ❌

           User: "Thanks everyone!"
           └─ triggerCount = 0 (session reset)
```

### Behavioral Summary

| trigger-cascade-limit | Total triggers allowed | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | Only first persona responds, no chains or multi-persona |
| 1 | 2 | First + 1 additional |
| 3 (default) | 4 | First + 3 additional |
| 10 (max) | 11 | First + 10 additional |

**Interaction with trigger-match-limit**: `effective_max_per_message = min(trigger-match-limit, trigger-cascade-limit + 1)`

### Key Insights

1. **First trigger is free**: The first persona activation in a session never counts against the limit
2. **Multi-persona and chains share one counter**: All additional triggers increment the same counter
3. **Shared counter**: All personas share the same trigger counter per channel
4. **trigger-match-limit caps breadth, trigger-cascade-limit caps total**: Together they control both dimensions

### Troubleshooting

**Personas not responding after several triggers?**
- Check if cascade trigger limit is reached
- Look for log: `Self-reply trigger limit reached (X)`
- Have a user send a message to reset the session
- Increase limit with `/config` > Engine > Trigger (max 10)

**Want to allow only the first persona to respond?**
- Set limit to 0: `/config trigger-cascade-limit limit:0`
- Only the first triggered persona will respond, no additional triggers

**Need to stop a persona chain without reopening the limit budget?**
- Send a natural stop message while your generation is active
- TomoriBot will stop the active stream and clear queued cascade work for that chain
- Unlike a normal user message, that stop message does not reset the trigger count

## Webhook Strategy

Webhook usage differs by environment:

### Production

- Uses a **single channel webhook** (`TomoriBot Multi-Persona`).
- Alters send messages through that webhook with:
  - `username` = persona nickname
  - `avatarURL` = `webhook_avatar_url` (S3 URL, never expires)
- **Avatar storage**: Uploaded to S3 during import
- **Robustness**: High (S3 URLs are permanent and centralized)

### Non-production (Local Development)

- Uses the same **shared channel webhook** (`TomoriBot Multi-Persona`) as production.
- Alters send messages through that webhook with:
  - `username` = persona nickname
  - `avatarURL` = public URL built from `AVATAR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when configured
  - otherwise TomoriBot mutates the shared webhook avatar from the local file immediately before sending
  - if no alter avatar resolves, TomoriBot resets the shared webhook avatar before sending so a previous local avatar cannot leak onto the next persona
- **Avatar storage**: Alter avatars are stored locally under `data/avatars/servers/{guildId}/personas/{personaId}/...`
- **Legacy persona webhooks** (`TomoriBot Persona {id}`) are no longer part of steady-state sending. They remain recovery sources for lazy migration and may be cleaned up manually later.

#### **Avatar URL Lifecycle (Local)**

1. **Import/default/server avatar update:** avatar is normalized to PNG and stored locally.
2. **DB write:** `webhook_avatar_url` is updated to the local stored path.
3. **Optional URL mode:** if `AVATAR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is configured, TomoriBot builds a public URL by stripping the `data/avatars/` prefix and appending the remainder to that base URL.
4. **Fallback mode:** if no public base URL is configured, TomoriBot loads the local file and mutates the shared webhook avatar for the send.

**Result:** Local installs no longer depend on per-persona webhooks just to persist avatar media.

#### **Lazy Migration for Existing Local Installs**

If an older local install still has an HTTP(S) avatar reference in `webhook_avatar_url`:

1. TomoriBot tries to download that avatar on first alter send.
2. The avatar is normalized to PNG, stored locally, and the DB is updated to the new local path.
3. If the HTTP(S) download fails, TomoriBot scans surviving legacy `TomoriBot Persona {id}` webhooks in the guild, recovers one avatar, stores it locally, and updates the DB.

Legacy persona webhooks are intentionally left in place by this migration. They are recovery sources, not part of the normal send path.

#### **Robustness Features (Local)**

##### **1. Auto-Recovery from Legacy Persona Webhooks**

**What:** When webhook avatar download fails (404), automatically scans guild for surviving webhooks with the same persona.

**Why:** Existing local installs may still only have webhook-backed avatar media. Recovery finds a surviving legacy webhook and migrates that avatar into local storage.

**Behavior:**
- Triggered on download failure during lazy migration
- Scans all text channels in guild for webhooks matching `TomoriBot Persona {id}`
- Downloads avatar from first surviving webhook found
- Stores avatar locally
- Updates database with the new local path
- Returns recovered avatar for immediate use

**Fallback:** If no surviving webhooks found, the send falls back to the owner name without a custom avatar (or to the original HTTP URL if it is still usable).

**Code location:** `src/utils/discord/webhookManager.ts` (`attemptWebhookAvatarRecovery`)

#### **Edge Cases (Local)**

**✅ Solved:**
1. **Webhook slot pressure** → local alters no longer create per-persona send webhooks
2. **Legacy URL expired** → lazy migration recovers from a surviving legacy webhook
3. **No public avatar host configured** → shared webhook avatar mutation fallback still preserves alter identity

**⚠️ Rare (Terminal):**
- **All legacy recovery sources gone and stored file missing** → manual re-import required
- **Operator configures `AVATAR_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` but does not actually serve `data/avatars/`** → avatar URLs will be broken until the host is fixed

**Mitigation:** Existing legacy webhooks are left untouched so old installs retain a recovery source. New installs do not need them for normal operation.

### Supported channels

Webhooks are supported in:
- `GuildText`

DMs do not support webhooks.

### Failure behavior

If webhook creation or sending fails:
- A localized warning embed is shown (rate-limited).
- The bot falls back to normal messages.

### Identity Resolution for Historic Messages

Main persona and alter messages carry their identity through **different Discord primitives**. Any code that needs to recover the author label for an older message (reply-context embeds, quote headers, memory extraction, etc.) must handle both.

| Persona type | Send path | Identity stored as | Recover via |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Main persona** | Bot's own Discord user (direct reply) | Bot's **guild member nickname at send time** | `message.member.displayName` |
| **Alter persona** | Shared channel webhook with per-send override | Per-message `username` override baked into the webhook send | `message.author.username` (+ `stripBridgePrefix`) |

**Why the asymmetry matters:** the currently active `tomoriState.persona_nickname` is **not** a safe proxy for the author of a historic message. It reflects "who is talking right now," not "who sent that older message." Using it to label prior messages causes cross-persona mislabeling whenever an alter switch has happened between send and now (e.g. Evil Lilya replying to an earlier Aphel message would render "Replying to Evil Lilya").

**Resolution order** (implemented in `src/utils/discord/webhookReply.ts` → `getReplyContextAuthorName`):

1. `message.webhookId` set → webhook message → use `stripBridgePrefix(message.author.username)`.
2. `message.author.id === botUserId` (non-webhook bot message) → prefer `message.member.displayName` (Discord snapshots this per message), fall back to current `botName` only if the member snapshot is missing.
3. Normal user message → `message.member.displayName ?? author.globalName ?? author.username`.

**Implication:** this works because TomoriBot renames its own guild member when the main persona is active. If a deployment disables that renaming, branch 2 will collapse back to `botName` and the same cross-persona mislabeling returns for main-persona history. Keep the guild-member rename tied to main-persona activation.

## Tool Calls, Embeds, and Stickers

### Tool-call embeds

Tools can send embeds via `sendStandardEmbed`. The tool execution context includes persona webhook info:

- If a webhook is available, embeds are sent through that webhook with persona name/avatar.
- Otherwise, embeds are sent as normal bot messages.
- Native voice-message REST sends serialize local-avatar changes through the same
  shared-webhook identity lock before delivery; `data:` avatars cannot be supplied
  through Discord's per-message `avatar_url` field.

The same shared webhook identity path is used for streamed chunks, tool embeds, generated images, sticker URL sends, reminder fallback pings, and manual alter impersonation.

### Persona IDs in context

When alter persona webhook messages are part of recent chat context, TomoriBot
surfaces those participants in "users in conversation" using the persona's
database `persona_id` (short numeric). This avoids production/local webhook ID
differences and gives tools a stable ID for avatar targeting.

Non-persona webhook participants (if any) are still surfaced by webhook ID.
Both are rendered as regular conversation users in context (no explicit webhook/persona
identity label).
Responding alter personas are injected into that list each turn, so they can
always self-target avatar tools with their own `persona_id` even when no previous
webhook message is present in the fetched history window.
When alter personas are active, TomoriBot suppresses the extra bot-account user
entry to avoid duplicate/confusing IDs in that list.

### Stickers (alter personas)

Discord webhooks cannot send actual stickers. For alters:
- After streaming, TomoriBot sends the **sticker CDN URL** via webhook.
- If webhook send fails, it falls back to sending the actual sticker as the bot.

Main persona uses normal sticker sends.

## Reminders (Persona-Specific)

Reminder tool now stores the creating persona:

- `create_task` saves `persona_id` in the `reminders` table.
- Reminder execution passes `selectedPersonaId` into `tomoriChat`.

Behavior:
- If the persona still exists, that persona responds.
- If the persona is missing, **fallback to main**.
- Mention verification includes webhook messages, and sends a fallback ping if the response did not mention the target.
- Reminder rows are deleted/rescheduled only after the generated delivery turn completes. If `/kill` stops the active turn or clears a queued reminder, delivery is not consumed; `next_attempt_at` schedules a retry after `REMINDER_DELIVERY_RETRY_DELAY_MS` without changing the canonical `reminder_time`.
- Automated retry errors stay silent. After `REMINDER_DELIVERY_MAX_RETRIES`, the raw scheduled content is shown once. One-time rows are removed, while recurring rows advance from the original cadence and remain available through `/scheduled-task edit` and `/scheduled-task remove`.

## Commands and Workflows

### `/persona import`

- `type: main` replaces main persona.
- Accepts native Tomori PNG exports, native Tomori JSON exports, plus supported SillyTavern PNG / JSON character cards.
- `type: alter` creates a new alter persona:
  - Unique triggers enforced (no overlaps).
  - Avatar reference stored in `webhook_avatar_url` (production URL or non-production local path).
  - If the imported card has no avatar image, the alter falls back to the current main persona avatar and the success embed explains that fallback.

### `/persona remove`

- Removes a selected alter persona.
- Deletes the stored avatar file/reference when present.
- Does **not** automatically delete legacy persona webhooks.

### Persona Memory Editing

- `/persona attribute add|edit|remove` manages ordered `persona_attributes` for a selected persona and mirrors text into `personas.attribute_list` for compatibility.
- Attribute add/edit modals include a public checkbox. Public attributes are exposed to other personas triggered by the same message; `{bot}` inside that text resolves to the attribute owner's name.
- `/persona sample-dialogue add|edit|remove` manages the paired `sample_dialogues_in/out` arrays for a selected persona.
- Edit flows reuse the existing persona picker and item selector, then show a confirmation button before opening a prefilled edit modal.

### `/config` > Persona > Identity & Personality

- Promotes an alter to main.
- Updates `persona_configs.trigger_words` for both personas (all trigger words unified in `persona_configs.trigger_words` after Phase 6 F1).
- Updates guild avatar and nickname.
- Stores the previous main avatar in `webhook_avatar_url`.
- Local alter avatars are loaded from the stored file path when present.

## Caching and Invalidation

### Persona cache

`getCachedAllPersonas()` loads and caches all personas for a server.

Invalidate cache after:
- Importing/removing/swapping personas.
- Updating triggers or avatars.

### Webhook cache

In-memory caches:
- `webhookCache` (shared channel webhook)
- `personaWebhookCache` (legacy per-persona webhook cache; retained for recovery / compatibility helpers)

**Cache behavior:**
- No TTL (persist until bot restart or manual invalidation)
- Shared channel webhook tokens are also stored encrypted in Postgres so restart recovery can restore the same webhook without recreating it
- Token validation on cache hit (recreates if webhook was deleted)
- Auto-invalidation on webhook errors (codes 10015, 50027)
- Avatar mutation sends also use a per-target-channel mutation lock so concurrent sends cannot cross-contaminate webhook avatars.

## Limitations and Edge Cases

### General

- **Context refresh**: later personas do not see earlier persona replies (deferred).
- **Webhook username collision**: reply routing relies on unique persona nicknames.
- **Setup re-run with a colliding alter**: `idx_personas_server_nickname_ci_unique` covers mains and
  alters alike, so an alter holding the default bot name (usually the previous main, demoted by a
  persona swap) would collide with the main persona that setup recreates. Setup renames that alter to
  `<name> [dup-<persona_id>]` before inserting, matching the suffix the schema already applies to
  legacy duplicates. Mains are never renamed: the alter yields the name.
- **DMs**: no webhook support; alters are not available in DMs.
- **Sticker rendering**: alter personas send sticker **URL previews** instead of actual stickers.

### Self-Reply Trigger Limits

- **Shared counter**: All personas share one trigger counter per channel (not per-persona).
- **Counter blocks all**: When trigger count exceeds limit, ALL additional persona triggers are blocked (user can reset by sending a message).
- **First trigger free**: The first persona activation in a session doesn't count against the limit.
- **Multi-persona counts**: Each persona activation after the first increments the counter, whether from multi-persona triggers or chains.

### Webhooks (Local Development)

- **Legacy URL expiration (mitigated)**: lazy migration copies old HTTP(S) avatar references into local storage on first use.
- **Legacy webhook deletion (mitigated)**: auto-recovery scans guild for surviving legacy persona webhooks during migration.
- **Terminal case**: if all legacy recovery sources are gone and no local file exists, avatar is unrecoverable without re-import.
- **Webhook limit**: steady-state local mode now uses one shared webhook per channel, so normal alter traffic no longer burns one webhook slot per persona.

## Troubleshooting

### Alter doesn't respond

1. **Check trigger words:**
   - Confirm trigger words are unique and present in `persona_configs.trigger_words`
   - Check if message contained the trigger or was a reply to alter webhook

2. **Check cascade trigger limit:**
   - Look for log: `Self-reply trigger limit reached (X)`
   - Have a user send a message to reset the session
   - Increase limit with `/config` > Engine > Trigger if needed

3. **Check webhook permissions:**
   - Verify bot has `MANAGE_WEBHOOKS` permission in channel
   - Check if channel supports webhooks (not DM)

### Alter has wrong avatar or name

1. **Webhooks failing:**
   - Check permissions (`MANAGE_WEBHOOKS`)
   - Look for warning embed in channel (rate-limited)
   - Check logs for webhook errors

2. **Local development avatar issues:**
   - Check whether `webhook_avatar_url` now points to a local `data/avatars/...` path
   - If legacy HTTP(S) value is still present, next use should trigger lazy migration
   - If migration fails:
     - Look for log: `Attempting legacy webhook recovery for persona X`
     - Confirm at least one legacy `TomoriBot Persona {id}` webhook still exists somewhere in the guild
   - If no recovery source exists, re-import the persona avatar

3. **DM limitations:**
   - Webhooks not supported in DMs
   - Alters will use main persona appearance

### Self-reply trigger issues

**Personas stop responding after several triggers:**
- Trigger limit reached (default: 3 additional after first)
- User message resets the trigger session
- Check current limit: `/config` > Engine > Trigger
- Increase limit (max 10) or set to 0 for first-trigger-only

**Personas triggering infinite loops:**
- Limit is too high
- Reduce limit with `/config` > Engine > Trigger
- Check persona personalities (may be too eager to mention each other)

## Test Checklist (Recommended)

### Basic Functionality

1. **Reply routing:** Reply to an alter's webhook message → same alter responds.
2. **Multi-trigger:** Trigger multiple alter keywords → all matching personas respond.
3. **Tool embeds:** Tool call as alter → embeds use alter webhook name/avatar.
4. **Stickers:** Sticker tool as alter → CDN URL sent via webhook.
5. **Reminders:** Reminder created by alter → alter delivers reminder; fallback to main if persona removed.

### Self-Reply Trigger Limits

6. **First trigger free:** User triggers 3 personas with trigger-cascade-limit = 1 → first 2 respond (first free + 1 additional), 3rd blocked.
7. **Chain triggers count:** Persona A → B → C → each additional trigger counts toward the limit.
8. **Multi-persona counts:** User message triggers B, C, D → each after the first increments the trigger counter.
9. **Session reset:** After trigger limit reached, user message → counter resets, personas respond again.
10. **Limit configuration:** `/config trigger-cascade-limit limit:5` → new limit applies immediately.

### Webhook Robustness (Local Development)

11. **Local storage:** Import alter or set alter avatar → verify `webhook_avatar_url` stores a `data/avatars/...` path in non-production.
12. **Lazy migration:** Existing local persona with HTTP(S) `webhook_avatar_url` → first alter send migrates to a local path.
13. **Recovery path:** Break the legacy HTTP(S) URL but keep one legacy `TomoriBot Persona {id}` webhook → next send recovers avatar and stores a local path.
14. **Shared webhook identity:** Use the same alter in multiple channels/threads → messages still show the correct persona sender without creating new persona webhooks.
15. **Restart recovery:** Restart the bot, then trigger an alter reply in the same channel → the existing shared webhook is restored from encrypted storage instead of being recreated, so recent alter messages remain manageable.
