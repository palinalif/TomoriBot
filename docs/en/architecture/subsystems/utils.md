## High-Impact Modules

### `utils/db`

- `client.ts`: DB client wiring
- `initializeDatabase.ts`: schema + seed startup runner
- `sqlSecurity.ts`: query parameterisation helpers
- `sqlSplitter.ts`: SQL file parsing utilities
- `ragAvailability.ts`: pgvector / RAG feature detection
- `repositories/`: 28 domain-owned repository modules + `index.ts` (shared instance + type re-exports only). SQL remains in its owning module; no `*ReadSql.ts` / `*WriteSql.ts` sibling files exist. `ErrorLogRepository` is a thin shim used by `logger.ts` to insert into `error_logs` without creating a circular import. See `docs/en/architecture/subsystems/database-schema.md` for the full repository table and SQL convention.

### `utils/discord`

- `commandLoader.ts`: command discovery + localization wiring
- `commandRegistry.ts`: runtime command maps used by handlers
- `interactionHelper.ts`: compatibility barrel for grouped UI helpers in `utils/discord/ui/`; new code imports the owned UI module directly
- `streamOrchestrator.ts`: public stream orchestration entry point backed by responsibility modules in `utils/discord/stream/`
- `webhookManager.ts`: compatibility barrel for grouped webhook helpers in `utils/discord/webhook/`; new code imports the owned webhook module directly
- `embedHelper.ts`: shared embed builders and senders (`createStandardEmbed`, `createSummaryEmbed`, `createTipText`, `sendStandardEmbed`); see [Tip modals](#tip-modals) below
- `textDisplayModal.ts`: reusable read-only text modal, trigger button, and collector wiring
- `resolveSendableChannel.ts`: cache-first, REST-fallback channel resolution for send paths, plus `isChannelGoneError` for the deleted-channel and lost-access cases
- `historyFetcher.ts`, `historyFormatter.ts`

#### Sending into a channel the cache no longer holds

`resolveSendableChannel(client, channelId)` returns the channel or the reason it could not be
reached, and reports a transient failure by throwing rather than flattening it into that reason.
`Message#channel` and `Message#reply` resolve through the client cache only, so discord.js raises
`ChannelNotCached` once an entry is gone. That happens both for a deleted channel and for one that
was never populated, and only a REST fetch separates them, so a long streaming turn re-resolves its
destination by id instead of trusting the `Message` it captured at admission.

Only two answers are terminal, and they are kept apart because they are different operator
problems: `10003` is a deleted channel, and `50001` (Missing Access) is one the bot can no longer
see. A rate limit, a 5xx, a timeout, or an abort is none of those and keeps its own error, so it
stays an ordinary send failure with its retry arms intact instead of stopping the stream.

`isChannelGoneError(error)` recognises both terminal answers, since a stopped stream is the same
verdict for each. The client-side `ChannelNotCached` is deliberately outside it: that says only
that the channel was absent from the local cache, which an uncached thread or an evicted DM entry
also produces, and the send path resolves that case with a fetch rather than reading it as a
deletion. `classifySendFailure` excludes it for the same reason, while still caching the
REST-confirmed `10003` as `channel_gone` for the admission gate.

Each terminal answer carries its own stop reason, so the log and the persisted `StreamResult` name
the condition that actually happened: a revoked grant reported as a deletion would send an operator
looking for a channel that still exists. Both stop reasons are internal requester ids, so they are
reaped at the end of the stream rather than aborting the next turn's pre-stream check.

The resolved channel is written back onto the stream context. One stream sends many chunks, and
only the first consults the reply target, so a context left pointing at a channel that cannot be
sent into would break every later chunk.

#### Tip modals

`createTipText(locale, tipKeys, tipVars?)` in `embedHelper.ts` builds the reusable markdown opened by
the **What You Can Do** button below an error (e.g. in `stream/errorUi.ts` and `ui/interactionCore.ts`).

- Each entry in `tipKeys` is an **atomic** locale key resolved independently and rendered as its own
  dashed bullet (`- item`). Keys live under `genai.tips.*` (see the Localization doc's
  [Tip-item keys](./localization.md#tip-item-keys-genaitips) convention).
- Tips render in a read-only Discord text-display modal, so markdown and hyperlinks remain usable
  without adding another embed or ephemeral reply to the channel.
- **Conditional tips are the caller's job**: include or omit a key inline (e.g. an OpenRouter-only
  item) instead of maintaining whole-paragraph tip strings per branch. Items that resolve to empty
  text are dropped, and the function returns `null` when nothing resolves, so the caller can skip
  attaching a tip button entirely.
- **The Official Support Server link is automatic**: `genai.tips.support_server` (exported as
  `SUPPORT_SERVER_TIP_KEY`) is appended as the last bullet of every rendered tip modal. Callers must
  not list it in `tipKeys`; it is filtered out if they do, so it can never be duplicated or
  reordered. It is appended *after* the empty check, so a tip modal with no caller-supplied items
  still returns `null` rather than degrading into a support-link-only embed.
- The button is disabled after `TIP_BUTTON_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 24 hours). The generic
  `textDisplayModal.ts` builder is also available to read-only legal and help surfaces.

- `mcpManager.ts`: MCP lifecycle

New code should use `utils/bridges` for generic bridge helpers and `utils/bridges/matrix` for Matrix runtime operations.

### `utils/image` and `utils/storage`

- `avatarHelper.ts`, `imageProcessor.ts`, `pngMetadata.ts`
- `avatarStorage.ts` for GCS or S3-compatible public avatar URL support
- `voiceSampleStorage.ts` for GCS or S3-compatible voice sample storage
- `charrefStorage.ts` for NovelAI character reference storage (S3-compatible in production, local filesystem in non-production)
- `S3_ENDPOINT` enables Cloudflare R2 or another S3-compatible endpoint; when set,
  storage clients use path-style requests while public URLs still come from the
  relevant `*_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` value.

### `utils/misc`

- `logger.ts`: structured logging facade
- `errorContextStore.ts`: ambient error identity (see below)
- `ioHelper.ts`: filesystem traversal helpers
- `healthTracker.ts`: runtime health signals used by `/health`

#### Ambient error context

`log.error()` and `log.warn()` accept an optional `ErrorContext`, but most call sites are far from
the code that knows which server or user they belong to. Threading that identity through every
signature is impractical, so `errorContextStore.ts` carries it out of band using an
`AsyncLocalStorage` scope.

The four entry points that begin a unit of work open a scope:

| Entry point | Opened in | `source` |
|---|---|---|
| Message chat turn | `events/messageCreate/tomoriChat.ts` | `chat` |
| Slash command | `events/interactionCreate/handleCommands.ts` | `command` |
| Scheduled reminder/task | `timers/reminderProcessor.ts` | `reminder` |
| Random trigger | `timers/randomTriggerProcessor.ts` | `random_trigger` |

Everything reached from inside a scope, at any await depth, logs with that identity attached. A
provider adapter deep in a stream needs no plumbing to produce an attributable error record.

- `runWithErrorContext(identity, fn)` opens a scope. Nested scopes inherit and override.
- `enrichErrorContext(patch)` upgrades the active scope once more IDs are known. Entry points seed
  Discord snowflakes; database row IDs are added after admission or user lookup resolves them.
- `resolveErrorContext(explicit)` is called by the logger. An explicit context wins per field, so a
  call site that names its own IDs stays authoritative.

Typed `ErrorContext` fields (`serverId`, `userId`, `personaId`) are database row IDs. Discord
snowflakes travel in `metadata` (`serverDiscId`, `userDiscId`, `channelDiscId`) alongside `source`
and `sourceDetail`, which identify the unit of work.

Timers and event handlers started *outside* a scope are unaffected, so background work that belongs
to no server stays unattributed rather than inheriting a stale identity.

## Usage Guidance

- Prefer these shared modules over duplicating logic in commands/events.
- For user-facing responses, always pair utility usage with localization via `localizer()`.
- For DB writes touching cached data, invalidate the affected caches in the same code path.
