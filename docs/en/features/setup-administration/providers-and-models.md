TomoriBot doesn't have a built-in AI model, you connect one from a provider. A **provider** is an AI
service (Google Gemini, OpenRouter, NovelAI, a local endpoint, …), and a **model** is a
specific model on that provider. You need at least one provider to use her at all.

## API Keys
<!-- anchor: api-keys -->

Add a provider key during first-time setup with `/setup`, or later from `/providers` by choosing
**Add New Provider**. Keys are **encrypted at rest**, so no one, including server admins, can read
them back.

`/setup` asks how replies should reach a model before anything else, and the answer decides what it
collects:

| Mode | What it collects |
|---|---|
| **AI Provider (Recommended)** | A provider from the catalog plus its API key, validated and encrypted as a draft. |
| **Custom Endpoint (Advanced)** | The endpoint's connection and one text model, registered inside the wizard. See [Custom Endpoints](#custom-endpoints). |
| **User BYOK** (guilds only) | Nothing: the workspace keeps no provider of its own, so members must supply personal ones. |

Nothing is written until **Finish Setup**, so an abandoned or expired wizard leaves the workspace's
existing provider rows alone. To replace a key that is already stored, use `/providers`, because
`/setup` refuses to run on a workspace that is already configured.

Each provider has its own key-generation steps. Run **`/help`**, choose **Setup**, then **Step 1: Get an API Key**, and pick your
provider for the exact walkthrough, or use these starting points:

| Provider | Notes | Get a key |
|---|---|---|
| **Google Gemini** | Free tier, runs every feature. Recommended first setup. | [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) |
| **OpenRouter** | One key, many models (some free). | [OpenRouter keys](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys) |
| **NovelAI** | Subscription; uncensored storytelling/roleplay (text only). | [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) |
| **DeepSeek** | Pay-as-you-go reasoning models. | [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) |
| **NVIDIA NIM** | Hosted text, embeddings, and image. | [NVIDIA Build](https://build.nvidia.com/) |
| **Anthropic** | Claude models via the API (not Claude Code). | — |
| **Z.ai** | GLM family. ⚠️ ToS restricts usage to coding/agent scenarios. | [Z.ai](https://z.ai/) |
| **Vertex AI** | Google Cloud via `gcloud` ADC (best for locally-run/dev setups). | see below |
| **Vertex AI Express** | Google Cloud API-key BYOK (Preview, Gemini subset). | [Express Mode](https://console.cloud.google.com/expressmode) |
| **Custom** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, LiteLLM, …). | see [Custom Endpoints](#custom-endpoints) |

:::caution
Never share your API key with anyone else. Add or replace a custom endpoint's Bearer auth token from its
**Edit Endpoint** action in `/providers`.
:::

**Vertex AI** authenticates with Application Default Credentials rather than a stored secret.
For local hosting, ADC can come from `gcloud`; hosted deployments should use a workload identity
or service account. An AI Studio API key alone does not authenticate full Vertex AI. The selected
project must have billing and the Vertex AI API enabled, and the host identity needs Vertex access.
The setup guide is available from **Google Vertex AI** on the **API Keys** page in `/help`.

Google-backed provider setup validates credentials through the authenticated model-listing
endpoint. It does not generate text or depend on whichever chat model is currently marked as
the catalog default, so a retired default cannot prevent a valid credential from being saved.

### Optional: Brave Search key

Brave Search is separate from your AI provider and only enhances web search (adds image,
video, and news search). Set it with `/providers`. ⚠️ Brave includes $5/month
free credit, so set a $5 usage limit in the Brave dashboard to avoid charges.

## Choosing Models

`/providers` manages server credentials, model catalogs, and endpoint registrations, while
`/config` > Models > Switch Models selects the shared capability assignments every member of this
server uses. Both need the required server permission. Individual members manage their own credentials
and model catalogs with `/personal providers`, then select personal models in `/personal config`.
Personal settings follow them across every server where they use TomoriBot. See
[Personalization](/features/knowledge/personalization/#your-own-providers) for that side.

The panels are titled **Server Providers** and **Personal Providers** so their ownership remains visible after
the command interaction opens.

After a provider is set, use `/config` > Models > Switch Models to choose the shared capability assignments.
The six ordinary slots select model entries from provider catalogs:

- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: the main chat model
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: a vision model (for reading images when the chat model can't)
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: embeddings for the [document knowledge base](/features/knowledge/memory/#document-knowledge-base-rag)
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: standard image generation (see [Image Generation](/features/capabilities/media-generation/image-generation/))
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: NovelAI image generation
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: video generation
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: text-to-speech (TTS) endpoint
- `/config` > Models > Switch Models: speech-to-text (STT) endpoint

The first six entries choose model catalog records. The TTS and STT slots choose workspace-scoped
endpoints instead, so they activate the selected endpoint rather than writing a model column. Register
and edit those endpoints in `/providers`; its endpoint activation control still works. `/personal config`
retains six personal model-routing slots and does not add personal TTS/STT endpoint selectors.

You can also manage this server's backup keys for automatic failover and load balancing with
`/providers`.

## Custom Endpoints
<!-- anchor: custom-endpoints -->

Custom endpoints let you register self-hosted or proxy-backed services (Ollama, LM Studio,
LiteLLM, vLLM, ComfyUI, local TTS/STT) as **labeled provider bundles**.

- **Server scope:** open `/providers` for workspace endpoint registration and editing.
- **Personal scope:** open `/personal providers` for personal model catalogs (just you: see
  [Personalization](/features/knowledge/personalization/#your-own-providers)). Personal speech endpoints
  are not selected from `/personal config`.

A **label** is the user-facing menu name and groups capabilities under one bundle when they share
one endpoint URL. It is never sent to the remote endpoint. Capabilities served from different URLs
need distinct labels. Choose **Add New Custom Endpoint**, select the
API compatibility, and save the connection. Saving prepares the capabilities supported by that
protocol without registering any models. Then select the new endpoint and use its model
dropdown to register an exact model code and capability. Adding a model activates it for that
capability. Use the same dropdown to attach more models or edit a workspace-added registration.
Text models declare their own capabilities in that form, and image models declare which request modes
they support.

For TTS and STT, register the endpoint and its models in `/providers`, then choose and activate the
endpoint in `/config` > Models > Switch Models. Those speech slots select an endpoint rather than a
model catalog entry. `/providers` remains the endpoint registration, model setup, and editing surface.

API compatibility determines the request paths and payloads the service implements, so it also determines which
capability slots the connection prepares. Registering exact models for those slots is a separate step, and the
protocol cannot be inferred reliably from the endpoint URL.

`/setup`'s **Custom Endpoint (Advanced)** mode performs the same two steps inside the wizard:
**Configure Connection** saves the API compatibility, label, URL, and optional auth token behind a
reachability check, and **Configure Text Model** registers the exact text model and its capability
declarations. The model button stays disabled until a connection validates, and re-saving the
connection clears the model declaration because the declarations depend on the API compatibility.
The wizard creates the connection, saved provider, model, and active-model rows together when you
press **Finish Setup**, so it never leaves a connection that has no usable text model. It registers
text models only; image, video, TTS, and STT capabilities are still registered in `/providers`.

## Supported Providers
<!-- anchor: supported-providers -->

If you don't have the hardware to host your own models, TomoriBot supports a wide range of
services. Not every feature is available on every provider.

### LLM Providers

| Provider | Streaming | Tool Calling | Image Input | Embeddings | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Google Gemini** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Free models available |
| **OpenRouter** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Free models available |
| **Anthropic (API)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | Not Claude Code |
| **NovelAI** | ✅ | ✅ | – | – | Only GLM 4.6 can use tools |
| **NVIDIA NIM** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Free models available |
| **DeepSeek** | ✅ | ✅ | – | – | – |
| **Z.ai** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | Free models; ⚠️ ToS = coding/agent use only |
| **Z.ai Coding** | ✅ | ✅ | – | – | Subscription plan |
| **Google Vertex AI** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Includes 'free' Express version |
| **Codex CLI (via ChatMock)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | – | [Setup](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-chatmock/) |

### Image Generation

| Provider | Text-to-Image | Image-to-Image | Inpainting | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Google** | ✅ | ✅ | – | – |
| **OpenRouter** | ✅ | ✅ | – | – |
| **NovelAI** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Can combine with other providers |
| **NVIDIA** | ✅ | – | – | Text-to-image only; reference images are ignored |
| **Z.ai** | ✅ | – | – | – |

These are the **defaults** a provider's image models start from, and NovelAI runs through its own pipeline
rather than this table. Registering an image model through `/providers` lets you declare that model's own
modes, which is how you enable inpainting on a ComfyUI workflow or on a provider model whose API supports
masked editing. A model you never declare keeps following the defaults above, so a later correction to them
reaches it automatically. Declare only what the model really does: Tomori offers the tool exactly the modes
you tick, and a mode the API rejects becomes a failed generation.

### Video Generation

| Provider | Text-to-Video | Image-to-Video | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Google** | ✅ | ✅ | Async polling workflow |
| **OpenRouter** | ✅ | ✅ | Async polling workflow |
| **Z.ai** | ✅ | ✅ | Async polling workflow |

### Voice & Audio

| Provider | Text-to-Speech | Speech-to-Text |
|---|---|---|
| **ElevenLabs** | ✅ | ✅ |

Local voice engines are covered under [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting/). For the built-in web
search and URL-fetch engines, see [Tools & Extensions](/features/capabilities/tools-and-extensions/#web-search--url-reading).
