TomoriBot gives server admins controls over how she behaves in your server (who can use her,
where, and how much she costs) through the `/config` panel and its related commands. Most require
the **Manage Server** permission. This page covers the highlights; every command is in the
[Command Reference](/features/command-reference/).

## Cost Control: Quotas
<!-- anchor: cost-control-quotas -->

Generation costs money (yours or your members'). Quotas cap usage per user and server-wide:

- `/moderation` → **Quotas**: configure daily per-user limits and resetting server-wide pools for text, image, and video generation.
- `/quota reset`: manually reset a user or server pool.

Set a per-user limit to `0` for unlimited. Server-wide pools reset on a configurable day
interval.

## User BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)
<!-- anchor: user-byok-bring-your-own-key -->

`/moderation` **((Member Access))** carries this as a two-state choice. **Allow Server Models** is the
default; **Require Personal Providers** makes each member bring their **own** personal provider for
their triggers, so the server pays for nothing on user-initiated messages. Server-initiated
triggers still use the server provider. This is the strongest cost control: it shifts API
spend entirely to members. Members set theirs up under
[Personalization → Your Own Providers](/features/knowledge/personalization/#your-own-providers).

You can also bootstrap a server with **no** server-side text provider at all by choosing
**User BYOK** during `/setup`. It is offered in servers rather than in DMs, and it asks for
confirmation before completing the provider step, because the workspace then has no provider to fall
back to.

## Access Control: Whitelists

- `/moderation` → **Whitelist** → **Channels**: choose triggering channels and optional cooldown overrides.
- `/moderation` → **Whitelist** → **Personas**: limit which channels a specific persona can trigger in.
- `/moderation` → **Whitelist** → **Roles**: restrict triggering to specific roles.
- `/config` > Engine > Trigger: set the global cooldown between responses.

Whitelisted channels inherit the global cooldown unless you set a channel-specific override.

## Learning & Privacy Controls

- `/server memberpermissions`: control who can teach her things.
- `/server blacklist`: prevent her from learning from or using memories about specific users.
- `/config` > Channels > Channel Rules: mark channels where short-term memory is isolated and thought
  logs are suppressed.

## Transparency: Thought Logs

`/server thought-logs` sets a channel where her internal reasoning and successful tool calls
are posted, useful for auditing what she's doing (including which trigger exposed a tool in
[Deliberate Tool Mode](/features/capabilities/tools-and-extensions/#deliberate-tool-mode)).

## Welcome Greetings

`/config` > Channels > Logs & Welcome configures an automated greeting for new members in a chosen
channel. By default, Tomori waits one minute before greeting them so server onboarding can
finish. Instance operators can tune this grace period with `WELCOME_DELAY_MS`. Use the
**Clear Welcome** button on that same page to stop greetings.

## Expressions

`/expressions initialize` registers your server's custom emojis and stickers so she
uses them accurately (recommended right after setup). For what she does with them (natural
`:emoji:` use, stickers, reactions), see
[Expressions & Reactions](/features/chatting-personality/chatting-and-triggers/#expressions--reactions).
