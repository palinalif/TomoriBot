TomoriBot is agentic: beyond chatting, she can call **tools** to search the web, read
documents, generate media, set reminders, act in other channels, and more. She decides when
to use them based on the conversation. This page covers the built-in tools, how to extend
her with MCP servers, and how to keep tool declarations lean with Deliberate Tool Mode.

Here are some silly examples:

- **1. Wellness Checker**
  ```text
  Every few hours, do a mandatory wellness check on @Bredrumb.
  Ask them how they feel right now and if they've taken a break from coding recently.
  Track their emotional state over time with {memory_tool} and/or {memory_update_tool} to report back to them later.
  ```
- **2. Weekly ~~Current Events~~ Yuri News**
  ```text
  Every Friday, compile the week's notable yuri manga chapters, anime episodes, and community fanart drops using {web_search_tool}.
  Present findings with {voice_message_tool} in a seductive ASMR voice.
  ```
- **3. Sleep Police**
  ```text
  If you notice through {message_metadata_tool} that someone is chatting past 2 AM, use {voice_message_tool} to send them a threateningly calm ASMR lullaby telling them to go to bed.
  If they keep talking 10 minutes later, use {manage_message_tool} to delete their message for their own good and remind them that sleep deprivation is a leading cause of their issues.
  ```

## Built-In Tools
<!-- anchor: built-in-tools -->

Tools depend on the active provider/model supporting tool calling, and many are gated behind
a feature flag (a `/config` > Permissions toggle), a Discord permission, a model capability, or
an optional API key.

| Tool | Prompt macro | Requires | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Review capabilities | `{capabilities_tool}` | — | Check current chat abilities, commands, or settings before answering. |
| Create / update long-term memory | `{memory_tool}` / `{memory_update_tool}` | `self_teaching_enabled` | Save or replace a stable server fact or user preference. |
| Update short-term memory | `{short_term_memory_tool}` | (not on NovelAI) | Save temporary working memory for the current channel/story arc. |
| Create / update task | `{task_tool}` / `{task_update_tool}` | — | Schedule or edit reminders and self-tasks (see [Scheduled Tasks](/features/capabilities/scheduled-tasks/)). |
| Cross-channel message | `{cross_channel_tool}` | (not on NovelAI) | Act in another channel/thread, with an optional report-back. |
| Create thread | `{create_thread_tool}` | `thread_creation_enabled` + thread perms | Open a public thread and post its starter message. |
| Select sticker | `{sticker_tool}` | `sticker_usage_enabled` | Add a matching server sticker to a reply. |
| Manage message | `{manage_message_tool}` | `manage_message_enabled` | Pin, edit, or delete recent messages (pin needs `Manage Messages`). |
| Block / unblock user | `{block_user_tool}` / `{unblock_user_tool}` | `user_blocking_enabled` | Persona-scoped mute/block of a user (does not touch memories). |
| Interact with recent message | `{message_interaction_tool}` | — | React to or send a short reply to a recent message. |
| Peek profile picture | `{profile_picture_tool}` | vision model or `vision_llm` | Inspect a user's or the persona's avatar. |
| Read document | `{document_tool}` | — | Extract text from a PDF or **any** UTF-8 text file: source code (`.py`/`.ts`/`.rs`/…), `.json`, `.yaml`, `.md`, `.txt`, and any non-binary attachment. |
| Reveal message metadata | `{message_metadata_tool}` | — | Annotate recent turns with handles/timestamps for precise targeting. |
| Process YouTube video | `{youtube_tool}` | model with video support | Analyze a specific YouTube link on demand. |
| Analyze image | `{image_analysis_tool}` | configured `vision_llm` | Delegate image understanding to a separate vision model. |
| Generate image / anime image | `{image_generation_tool}` / `{anime_image_generation_tool}` | `imagegen_enabled` + capable provider | Generate or edit images (see [Media Generation](/features/capabilities/media-generation/)). |
| Generate voice message | `{voice_message_tool}` | ElevenLabs key + persona voice + `voice_message_enabled` | Send a spoken Discord voice reply. |

:::note[For prompt authors]
When customizing her system prompt or persona instructions, reference tools by their **prompt
macros** from the table above rather than hardcoding tool names, because the macros expand to the
correct names at context-assembly time and degrade gracefully when a tool isn't available.
`{pin_tool}` and `{timestamp_refresh_tool}` still work as compatibility aliases for
`{manage_message_tool}` and `{message_metadata_tool}`. The web search and URL tools below
have macros too: `{web_search_tool}`, `{image_search_tool}`, `{video_search_tool}`,
`{news_search_tool}`, `{url_fetch_tool}`, and `{url_metadata_tool}`: these resolve
dynamically to the best available engine, including guild MCP replacements.
:::

### Conditional Prompt Blocks

Prompt text that supports the tool macros above also supports scoped conditionals:

```text
{{if capability:self_teaching}}
Use {memory_tool} when a detail is worth remembering.
{{else}}
Do not promise to save long-term memories.
{{/if}}
```

Use `capability:<name>` for an enabled TomoriBot setting, or `tool:<function_name>` when
the text should appear only if that exact tool is available to the active provider and
model. Use `tool_family:url_fetch` when either the bundled URL reader or a guild MCP
replacement is available. Prefix a condition with `!` to invert it. Blocks can be nested
and may contain one `{{else}}`; general `and`/`or` expressions are not supported.

The supported capability names are `tool_use`, `self_teaching`, `personal_memories`,
`emoji_usage`, `sticker_usage`, `web_search`, `manage_message`, `thread_creation`,
`image_generation`, `video_generation`, `voice_message`, `user_blocking`,
`short_term_memory`, and `time_awareness`.

Tool conditions reflect provider/model support, server configuration, configured backends,
MCP replacements, and the current Deliberate Tool Mode allowlist. They do not bypass or
predict Discord permission checks performed when a tool executes. Unknown capability names
evaluate as false and are logged; malformed blocks are omitted. Raw chat messages, model
output, and tool results are never treated as conditional templates.

## Web Search & URL Reading
<!-- anchor: web-search--url-reading -->

The model sees a single unified `web_search(query, category)` tool. Behind it, a dispatcher
routes each call through an engine chain and returns the first success:

**Brave → SearXNG → DuckDuckGo → IAsk**

- **Brave** runs first when a Brave API key is configured (set it with
  `/providers`); it adds image, video, and news search. ⚠️ Set a $5 usage limit
  in the Brave dashboard to avoid surprise charges.
- **DuckDuckGo** is the default when no key is set, cascading to **IAsk** on rate limits or empty results.
- **SearXNG** and **Crawl4AI** are optional self-hosted sidecars that unlock more categories
  and browser-rendered page fetches; see [Self-Hosting](/self-hosting/).

For reading a specific page, she uses `fetch_url`. It's unavailable on NovelAI.

## MCP Servers
<!-- anchor: mcp-servers -->

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (Model Context Protocol) servers extend her with
external tools you register yourself.

### Adding an Online MCP

Any publicly hosted MCP server with an HTTPS endpoint works. Using
[Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) as an example:

1. Create an account and generate an API key from your profile.
2. Open an MCP in the catalog and copy its **connection URL** (e.g. `https://youtube.run.tools`).
3. Open `/config` > Plugins > MCP Servers, choose **+ Add MCP**, paste the connection URL into **URL**, paste your
   Smithery key into **Auth Token**, and choose the required **Server Type**. **General
   Purpose** is selected by default.

If a server needs no auth, leave **Auth Token** blank. Your auth token is encrypted at rest
and never shown again. Open the same Config page to inspect configured state, enable or disable a server,
or remove one with explicit confirmation. Removal disconnects it immediately and frees a slot.
Each saved row also shows the bounded tool names from its last successful discovery. **None
discovered** is a known zero-tool result; **Discovery unknown** identifies a legacy row or a server
that has no successful snapshot yet. Opening the MCP management surface only reads saved metadata and does not contact the
remote server.

### Local MCP Servers

Local MCP servers are **only supported on self-hosted instances**, because the public hosted bot
requires HTTPS and blocks local/private addresses. If you run your own instance, see
[Setup: Local MCP Server](/self-hosting/local-endpoints/setup-local-mcp/).

:::danger[Only add MCP servers you trust]
A malicious MCP server can **prompt-inject** her with hidden instructions, **exfiltrate**
data users pass to its tools, or return **harmful/false results** she'll relay to your
server. Treat MCP servers like browser extensions: if in doubt, don't add it. Always review
an MCP's described tools before adding it.
:::

## Deliberate Tool Mode
<!-- anchor: deliberate-tool-mode -->

Every declared tool adds to the prompt. **Deliberate Tool Mode** keeps tool declarations out
of ordinary chat turns unless the message looks like it actually needs a tool; this reduces
prompt size and helps smaller/local models answer faster.

- She first checks the message for **tool intent**. Built-in triggers cover common requests
  (reminders, web search, memory updates, cross-channel messages, image/video/voice
  generation, media analysis, thread creation, message actions). Questions about her current
  model, tools, settings, or why a capability is unavailable expose capability review and
  official documentation access together. Follow-up wording works too, like "do that again
  but angrier" after a voice-message request.
- Server managers can add literal **custom trigger phrases** with `/server trigger add`, for
  example mapping `pic`, `img`, or `pfp` to image generation.
- The built-in triggers read English phrasing. Other languages reach the same tools through
  each language's keyword list. Every shipped language's list is checked on every message,
  whatever your language setting is, so a bilingual server works in both languages.
- Custom phrases in Japanese, Chinese, or Korean also match inside longer words, because those
  languages do not separate words with spaces. A phrase ending in `*` matches any word that
  starts with it: `remind*` covers `reminder` and `reminding`.

### Controls

- `/server dtm`: server managers toggle it.
- `/personal config`: users override it for themselves.
- With a thought-log channel configured (`/server thought-logs`), successful deliberate-mode
  tool calls are logged there along with the trigger that exposed the tool.

Deliberate Tool Mode only decides which tools are *shown* to the model, but the model still has
to choose to call one. In `/help`, choose **Behavior**, then **Deliberate Tool Mode**, for the Discord summary.

:::note
**Deliberate Tool Mode** (this section) is unrelated to **Deliberate Trigger Mode**, which
controls how *she* is triggered; see
[Chatting & Triggers](/features/chatting-personality/chatting-and-triggers/#deliberate-trigger-mode). Both are
abbreviated "DTM" in Discord.

## Structured User Info Updates

The built-in `update_user_info` tool handles explicit requests to change a registered user's
nickname, prefix, suffix, gender identity, pronouns, addressing style, or numeric UTC offset.
It uses the same collision-aware name, alias, mention, and Discord-ID resolver as other
personal tools. An omitted target means the human who triggered the turn; `all` and `everyone`
are never wildcard targets.

Each field is its own optional parameter, so a change is expressed by passing the field. Removal
is a `clear` list of field names, which keeps one rule for the text, enum, and numeric fields
alike; a blank string is folded into a removal rather than rejected. There is no scope or action
parameter, because scope follows the field:

| Fields | Stored | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| nickname, prefix, suffix | per persona lineage | only the persona that made the change addresses them differently |
| gender identity, pronouns, addressing style, timezone | once per user | every persona reads the same value |

That split follows storage rather than preference: the identity fields have a single slot per
user and no per-persona equivalent. The success notice labels persona-scoped rows with the
persona's name, so the difference is visible rather than implied. An unlabelled row is global,
which needs no explanation of its own because global is the unsurprising case.

Participant context names each user's prefix and suffix separately from their nickname, so a
request to drop a title resolves to an affix change instead of a nickname rewrite. A cleared
affix is stored as an explicit suppression, so the removal cannot be undone by a lower
precedence layer still supplying a value.

When a nickname is submitted with an affix that is already resolved, the redundant affix is
stripped by comparing against the resolved value; the nickname is never split on whitespace to
guess a boundary. An update reports the resulting form of address whenever that name actually
moved, so an addressing-style switch is visible in the same turn even though no naming field
appeared in it, while a pronoun or timezone edit does not restate a name nothing touched.

Every field is validated before one atomic write. Restrictive privacy blocks additions and
changes but still permits clearing values. The tool cannot edit persona-wide address terms. The
default-on User Info Updates switch in `/config` > Permissions controls both tool exposure and
stale-invocation defense. Manual `/personal config` remains available when it is off.
