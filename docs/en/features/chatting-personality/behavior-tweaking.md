TomoriBot's behavior (**what she's allowed to do and how she generates**) is controlled by
`/config` > Permissions and `/config`, beyond personality ([Multiple Personas](/features/chatting-personality/multiple-personas/))
and knowledge ([Memory](/features/knowledge/memory/)). This page is a curated set of the high-value
knobs; every command is in the [Command Reference](/features/command-reference/).

## Capabilities: What She's Allowed to Do
<!-- anchor: capabilities-what-shes-allowed-to-do -->

`/config` > Permissions toggles her features on and off: image generation, sticker usage, thread
creation, message management, user blocking, self-teaching, voice messages, and more. Each
toggle is the feature flag that gates the matching tool (see
[Tools & Extensions](/features/capabilities/tools-and-extensions/)). Turn something off and she simply
can't do it, no matter what a user asks.

## Generation Tuning
<!-- anchor: generation-tuning -->

- `/config` > Models > Text Samplers & Parameters: sampling parameters (temperature, top-p, …): creativity/randomness.
  Higher temperature is more varied.
- `/config` > Engine > General: how human-like her responses read. The optional `scope` option
  applies the degree server-wide (`Global`, the default) or to a single persona
  (`Persona`), handy when one persona should text casually at degree 3 while another texts like a novel. A persona's "Inherit" choice clears its override.
- `/config` > Engine > General: how many recent messages she pulls as context per trigger.
  A useful lever: raise it for more conversational awareness, lower it to cut token cost.

## System Prompt
<!-- anchor: system-prompt -->

The system prompt sits above the persona and shapes overall behavior:

- `/config` > Engine > General: set a custom system instruction (up to 16,000 characters).
- `/config` > Engine > General: choose from preset system prompts.
- `/config` > Engine > General: reset to the default. The confirmation shows the prompt it just
  removed, so you can copy it back out if you cleared it by accident.

When a [SillyTavern preset](/features/integrations/sillytavern-support/) is active, the built-in fallback
system prompt is replaced, but a custom one you set here is still sent.

## Uncensored Output
<!-- anchor: uncensored-output -->

TomoriBot has **no content filter of its own**: she is not a moderation harness and adds no
safety rails on top of the model. Whatever the underlying provider returns is what she says.
`/nsfw jailbreaks` therefore doesn't "unlock" anything inside TomoriBot; it exists purely to
work around **provider-side** filters that are stricter than you want.

It toggles three independent techniques (all off by default):

- **Prompt injection**: adds a jailbreak instruction block to the context to steer the model
  away from unnecessary refusals.
- **Unicode spaces**: swaps normal spaces for a look-alike Unicode space so keyword/token
  filters don't match on phrases, on the text sent to the model and on her reply.
- **Sanitize**: obfuscates a set of sensitive words for the same reason, likewise on both
  the request and the response.

None of these change what the model is *capable* of; they only reduce how often an
over-eager provider filter blocks otherwise-normal output. Some of these options are
age-restricted; see
[Age-Restricted Commands](/features/setup-administration/age-restricted-commands/).

## Appearance & Time

- `/config` > Persona > Identity & Personality: what she calls herself.
- `/config` > Engine > General: the server timezone, used for time-aware replies and reminders.
