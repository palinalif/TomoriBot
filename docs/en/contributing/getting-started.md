This guide sets up TomoriBot locally with Bun + PostgreSQL.

## Prerequisites

- Bun
- PostgreSQL
- A Discord bot application with:
  - `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes
  - Privileged intents enabled in Discord Developer Portal:
    - `Server Members Intent`
    - `Message Content Intent`
  - `Presence Intent` is optional (used only outside production)

## 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

## 2. Create Local Environment File

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`.env.example` is intentionally minimal and only includes the required local setup values.

Minimum required values for local development:

```dotenv
DISCORD_TOKEN=...
CRYPTO_SECRET=...
POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_USER=...
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
POSTGRES_DB=tomodb
RUN_ENV=development
```

Notes:

- Runtime uses `RUN_ENV` (not `NODE_ENV`) for production/dev branching.
- In production mode (`RUN_ENV=production`), secrets are fetched from AWS Secrets Manager (`tomoribot/production`) unless `TEST_PRODUCTION=true`.
- Additional tuning and feature flags live in `.env.optional.example`. Copy only the values you actually want into `.env`.

## 3. Prepare PostgreSQL

Create a DB/user, then ensure `.env` credentials match.

## 4. Start the Bot

```bash
bun run dev
```

Expected startup stages include:

- secrets loading
- encryption key manager init
- schema + seed verification
- tool registry init
- locale init
- cache warmup
- event handler setup
- Discord login

## 5. First-Time Discord Setup

Run in your test server:

```text
/setup
```

The command requires **Manage Server** and answers with a private checklist panel that only you can
operate. Its items are a draft: **Finish Setup** is the only control that writes, so opening, editing,
or cancelling leaves the database untouched. A draft is process-local, so a restart discards it too;
`SETUP_DRAFT_MAX_ENTRIES` (default 200) bounds pending drafts in `.env.optional.example`.

Under `RUN_ENV=development` the panel renders two steps:

- **AI Provider** offers one String Select with three access modes. **AI Provider (Recommended)**
  opens the provider catalog plus an API key field and validates the key before encrypting it into the
  draft. **Custom Endpoint (Advanced)** repaints the panel with **Configure Connection** and
  **Configure Text Model**, and the model button stays disabled until a connection validates; both
  write nothing before **Finish Setup**, unlike the same registration in `/providers`.
  **User BYOK** is offered in guilds only and confirms that members must supply their own personal
  providers, so the workspace keeps no server-side text provider.
- **Starting Settings** is one four-row modal: persona, reply style, timezone, and the workspace
  default system prompt. **Built-in Default (Recommended)** stores no prompt text, so it keeps
  tracking the shipped default, and a catalog preset stores that preset's text at commit time.

`RUN_ENV=production` adds a third step, **Policies**, which accepts the Terms of Service and the
Privacy Policy in one modal; add `TEST_PRODUCTION=true` to exercise that layout locally without AWS
Secrets Manager. The same switch decides whether `/legal terms-of-service` and
`/legal privacy-policy` are registered, and `/legal license` is registered in every environment.

To save and activate an additional provider afterward:

```text
/providers
```

Choose **Add New Custom Endpoint** to save its API compatibility and connection details, then select
the saved entry and use its model dropdown to register and activate a model capability. Later changes
to that registration can be done in place with `/providers`.

Then use `/config` > Models > Switch Models whenever you want to switch to another saved provider or model later.

Common saved providers:

- `provider:openrouter`
- `provider:novelai`

The old inline `custom` provider path is deprecated. Use `/providers` instead.

## Common Development Commands

```bash
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run start
bun run lint
bun run check
bun run check-runtime-imports
bun run vl
bun run nuke-db
bun run backup
bun run purge-commands
bun run check-locales
bun run check-limits
bun run check-media-size
bun run compress-media
```

`bun run vl` runs every validation gate and prints one verdict per gate, ending with a machine
readable `vl-status:` line. It is quiet by default: a passing gate prints no output, and a failing
gate prints its full detail. Pass `--verbose` to see everything each gate would print on its own. See
[`development-tasks.md`](./development-tasks) for the full behavior and for the redirect pattern that
keeps the exit code intact.

`bun run check-runtime-imports` verifies that critical runtime dependencies load and that
`bun.lock` preserves their compatible transitive versions. It also runs as a fatal check in
`bun run vl` and CI.

`bun run check-media-size` (also bundled into `bun run vl`) rejects tracked media
over a per-file budget (default 1 MiB, set via `MEDIA_SIZE_LIMIT_BYTES`). It scans
`src/db/seed/catalog/personas/**` (Default Persona avatars/sprites that ship to
Discord) and `assets/img/**`.

`bun run compress-media` fixes offenders automatically: it re-encodes losslessly
(max deflate, metadata stripped, so color stays Δ0) and only downscales a file when
lossless alone cannot reach the budget, capping the long edge at `MEDIA_MAX_DIMENSION`
(default 768px). Use `--dry-run` to preview, or pass a path substring to target one file.
Note: these PNGs are already near-optimally compressed, so lossless rarely fits 1 MiB on
its own: downscaling (invisible at Discord's <=128px avatar render size) is the trade.

`compress-media` also normalizes release cards under `.github/release/**` (not gate-scoped)
to WebP q`RELEASE_CARD_WEBP_QUALITY` (default 90) at full resolution, rewriting sibling
`release-notes.md` references. Already-WebP cards are skipped (re-encoding lossy WebP each
run would degrade it). That tree lives on the `release` branch only, so run this from a
`release` checkout. During deployment, the release workflow rewrites the card URL to the immutable
release tag and tags the deployed commit. After converting a card for an already-published release,
you must still update its published body (`gh release edit`).

## Quick Health Checks

- `/ping`
- `/status`
- Mention the bot or use trigger words in chat

## Troubleshooting

- Command registration issues: run `/refresh`
- Type errors: `bun run check`
- Formatting/lint: `bun run lint`
- Locales mismatch: `bun run check-locales`
