## Development Checklist

Run these before merging any change:

```bash
bun run check           # TypeScript strict mode
bun run lint            # Biome lint/format
bun run check-locales   # locale key parity (when locale keys or command metadata changed)
bun run find-stale-translations --reason=unfollowed --base=origin/main  # branch follow-up, advisory
bun run db:lifecycle    # schema lifecycle test (when schema.sql changed; needs local PostgreSQL)
```

`bun run lint` applies fixes in place, so it can leave your working tree changed after it reports
success. Commit whatever it rewrites: CI runs `bun run lint:ci`, which is the same Biome check
without `--fix`, and that one fails on formatting instead of silently correcting it.

`bun run db:lifecycle` requires a local disposable PostgreSQL target with CREATE/DROP database
permission. It creates and drops its own temporary database, then tests fresh initialization plus
backup/restore and DB maintenance scripts.

To run selected regression files through the same disposable-database harness, pass their paths to
the test script:

```bash
bun run test tests/regression/db/llm.regression.test.ts
```

### One command for every gate

`bun run vl` runs the whole check suite and prints one verdict per gate, so it is the fastest way to
answer "is this branch green" without remembering each script name:

```bash
bun run vl
```

Its last line is machine readable, which matters when a wrapper or an agent reads the result rather
than a person:

```
vl-status: PASS exit=0 pass=<n> warn=<n> fail=<n> skip=<n>
```

**Output is quiet by default.** No flag means quiet; `--verbose` is opt-in. A gate that passes prints
nothing, and its row in the results block carries the verdict. A gate that fails always prints its full
detail, so quiet mode can never hide a finding; it only removes the passing noise around one. Advisory
detail, such as locale parity or the lockfile-wide `bun audit` listing, collapses to a count or to the
entries that changed the verdict.

Pass `--verbose` to restore every line each gate would otherwise print:

```bash
bun run vl --verbose
```

`--no-verbose` is the explicit spelling of the default rather than a mode of its own: it produces the
same output as passing nothing. It exists so `vl` can force quiet onto the checks it invokes, and it
wins over `--verbose` regardless of the order the two appear in. It is never required.

Individual gates accept both flags, and `vl` forwards one to them. Redirect the output to a file
if you want to keep the exit code while reading selectively, and never pipe a gate through `grep` or
`tail`: the pipeline reports the filter's exit status instead of the gate's.

```bash
bun run vl > /tmp/vl.log 2>&1; echo "VL_EXIT=$?" >> /tmp/vl.log
```

## Coding Conventions

These rules apply to all TomoriBot source code regardless of task type.

### Formatting and Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation (Biome project setting).
- Use double quotes for strings.
- Write comments that explain rationale, constraints, or non-obvious behavior. See the
  [`comment policy`](./comment-policy).
- Run `bun run lint` after edits.

### TypeScript and Validation

- Keep TypeScript strict; avoid `any`.
- Prefer explicit shared types under `src/types/`.
- Use Zod/runtime validation for untrusted external input.
- Add concise JSDoc for exported/public functions when behavior is non-obvious.

### File Organization and Imports

- Use `camelCase` file names.
- Use `@/*` path aliases for `src/*` imports.
- Use `node:` protocol for Node built-ins (`node:path`, `node:fs`, etc.).

### Configuration and Magic Numbers

- Do not hardcode operational limits/timeouts/thresholds in feature logic.
- Use env vars with fallback defaults:

```ts
const VALUE = Number.parseInt(process.env.CONFIG_VAR || "10", 10);
```

- Add required setup vars to `.env.example` and optional/tuning vars to `.env.optional.example`,
  each with a clear comment. See [`adding-env-variable.md`](./adding-env-variable) for the tier
  system and placement conventions.

### Database and Migrations

- Use Bun SQL template literals for queries.
- Keep schema migrations idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`, helper functions, guarded blocks).
- For DB model details, see [`docs/en/architecture/subsystems/database-schema.md`](../subsystems/database-schema).

### Cache-Safe Write Pattern

When a write affects cached reads:

1. Perform the DB write successfully.
2. Then invalidate affected cache key(s).

Do not invalidate before failed writes, and do not manually mutate cached objects.
See [`docs/en/architecture/subsystems/caching.md`](../subsystems/caching) for the cache map and invalidation APIs.

### Logging and Error Handling

- Use `log` from `src/utils/misc/logger.ts`.
- Include useful context metadata (`errorType`, IDs, action context).
- Treat startup-critical failures differently from recoverable runtime failures.

### Discord Command Rules

- Slash commands only (no legacy prefix command surface).
- All user-facing text must be localized via `localizer()`.
- Follow interaction timing patterns in [`docs/en/architecture/subsystems/command-system.md`](../subsystems/command-system).
