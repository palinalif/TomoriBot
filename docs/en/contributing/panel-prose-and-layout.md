title: "Panel Prose and Layout"
---

Rules for text and component arrangement inside a Components V2 panel, the writable
ephemeral surfaces built from `src/utils/discord/ui/*Panel.ts`. Discord renders these
differently from an embed, so several habits that are harmless elsewhere are defects here.

Every rule below has a failure it prevents. Where a gate enforces one, the gate is named.

## Runtime wrapping

**Write natural localized prose and use newlines only for semantic structure.** Paragraphs,
lists, quote rows, and stored-content boundaries belong in the source. Soft line breaks added only
to shape the panel do not.

Every panel must pass its component tree through `buildPanelContainer()` in
`src/utils/discord/ui/panel.ts`. That shared boundary formats every descendant `TextDisplay` before
Discord's hard limits are validated. It measures visible Markdown content, preserves complete
tokens and grapheme clusters, and never truncates prose to satisfy the visual policy.

The component tree selects its own layout profile. A `TextDisplay` nested in a `Section` with a
`Thumbnail` accessory uses the narrower profile automatically. Moving the same text into or out of
that section requires no width argument, locale edit, or test allowlist. Measured widths remain an
internal policy in `panelProse.ts` because Discord exposes no panel viewport or text-width field.
Text containing hiragana or katakana selects a narrower Japanese profile automatically. Han-only
Chinese text keeps the default profile.

Links, inline code, emphasis, strikethrough, escaped Markdown, custom emoji, and URLs remain intact
while wrapping. A single token wider than the policy stays whole on its own line. Fenced blocks are
verbatim regions: the formatter preserves their bytes, including their existing line endings. Use
a fenced `markdown` block for stored user content as described below.

Visual wrapping and Discord limits are separate concerns:

Runtime content is still bounded, but by a different mechanism depending on where it lands, and
the two are not interchangeable:

- **Select slots** use `safeSelectOptionText`: option labels, values and descriptions, select
  placeholders, and modal titles and field labels. It bounds one slot against that slot's own
  ceiling and knows nothing about the rest of the message.
- **Body text** in a `TextDisplay` uses `buildTextPreview` against a budget derived from the
  page's measured chrome, then the whole payload is checked by
  `validateComponentsV2MessageLimits`. Discord caps a message at 4,000 codepoints across every
  `TextDisplay`, so a body preview that fits its own slot can still make the message invalid.

Reaching for `safeSelectOptionText` to bound a body string is a category error: it returns a
string short enough for a select option, which says nothing about the message-wide budget the
body actually competes for.

## Per-line markers

**`-#` and `>` apply to one line each.** Add the marker once to the semantic source line. The
runtime formatter repeats it on every visual continuation line:

```ts
content: `-# ${localizer(locale, "commands.providers.stale_warning")}`,
```

Keep `withLinePrefix` for content that already contains several semantic rows and needs a marker on
each one before wrapping. Do not use it to manufacture layout-only line breaks.

## Structure

- `##` for a page title that contains major sections.
- `###` for a page heading without nested sections, or for a major section heading.
- A select may stand in for a heading when its closed value names the same thing. A closed select renders
  its default option's label, so `/help` puts the section select where the section title would go and a
  `##` line above it would only repeat the active section's name.
- **Bold** for a nested subsection label.
- Plain text for short explanations and empty states.
- Quote rows (`>`) for current values, statuses, and entities.
- Give every settings subsection a short plain-text sentence that explains its purpose or
  effect before its values or controls. A label alone should not require the reader to infer
  what the setting changes.
- Keep a quote row immediately adjacent to the explanation, label, or control it qualifies.
  Do not insert a blank line between them. Use blank lines to separate sibling subsections.
- Subdued `-#` lines for live cross-command directions and footer-like qualifications.
- A real Components V2 separator between the top category controls and the page body.
- A populated list section explains what its entries mean before rendering rows.
- Whole ```markdown``` code blocks for big dynamic content (like memories)
- A direct state control renders its heading and explanation first, its mutually exclusive
  choice buttons second, and the selected choice's effective behavior in a quote row below.
  The result then reads as belonging to the choice that produces it.
- A persona-scoped page places its persona selector before the heading, thumbnail, and details that
  it controls. When only one page is persona-scoped, the order is category, page, persona, content.
  When Persona is itself a category with nested pages, the order is category, persona, page,
  content. Omit the thumbnail only when neither a public URL nor a readable local avatar is
  available. Local avatars use `attachment://` media and must be reattached while old message
  attachments are cleared on every repaint.

Prefer first-person `I` and `me` when the bot is the speaker.

## Defaults and effective values

**Put the authoritative current or effective value in the panel.** When a built-in,
inherited, provider, or server default changes how that value should be understood, show the
default and its source there too. Opening an editor must not be required just to discover the
effective behavior.

Prefill the stored value in a modal when Discord supports it. Modal field descriptions repeat
only guidance needed while editing, such as the valid range and what clearing or resetting
restores. They supplement the panel rather than becoming the only place a default is explained.

## Content blocks

**Render stored user content as a fenced `markdown` block, not as a quote row.** A quote row
reads as panel chrome; a fence reads as the thing the user saved, which is what a memory or a
prompt body is.

Do not markdown-escape text inside a fence: escapes render literally there. Instead make the
content fence-safe, because a value containing its own backtick run would close the fence early
and spill the rest of the panel into the block. `renderMemoryBlock` in
`personalMemoriesPanel.ts` is the worked example.

**Use `neutralizeFenceRuns` from `@/utils/text/discordTextLimits`, and never replace the literal
triple backtick.** The literal replacement does not converge. Rewriting ``` as `` `<zwsp>`` ``
leaves a run of four backticks as `` `<zwsp>``` ``, whose tail is still a closing delimiter, and
applying the same pass twice does not fix it. `neutralizeFenceRuns` interleaves a zero-width
space through the whole run, so no two backticks remain adjacent at any run length.

Guard **before** truncating, not after. The guard expands a run of `N` backticks to `2N - 1`
codepoints, so guarding a string that was already cut to the budget can push it back over.

## Jargon

**Link a product term to its documentation the first time a panel names it.** Terms like
Short-Term Memory, spotlight, or lineage read as invented vocabulary to a new user, and a
panel has no room to define them:

```ts
stm_title: `[Short-Term Memory](https://docs.tomoribot.app/en/features/knowledge/memory/#short-term-memory-stm)`,
```

Keep the `/en/` locale segment, matching every other documentation link in `src/locales/`.
A link inside a heading is fine: its URL costs no rendered width.

## Selectors

- Say what the select does above it, and say that adding happens there too when the first
  option is an add action: `Select or add a personal memory below:`. The add affordance lives
  inside the dropdown, so a user who is not told will not look for it.
- Option values must be unique. Discord rejects the entire payload with
  `COMPONENT_OPTION_VALUE_DUPLICATED`, and no static gate catches it, so deduplicate whenever
  the value is a key that several rows can share.
- Cap options at 25 and paginate the select in place when more records exist. Put a button row
  immediately below it in this order: Previous, a disabled `Page <current> of <total>`
  indicator, then Next. Disable Previous and Next at their respective boundaries.
- Do not replace the panel body with a range chooser or merely report hidden selectable rows.
  Keep the selected stable identity and the page body while moving between slices.
- An add action inside a select is its first option on every page. It consumes one of Discord's
  25 option slots, leaving 24 record options. Omit the pagination row when one page is enough.
- **Pagination buttons carry a direction arrow: `← Previous` and `Next →`.** The arrow leads on the
  way back and trails on the way forward, so the pair reads as a line the reader moves along. Use
  `←` (U+2190) and `→` (U+2192), never `<`/`>`, which are comparison operators, and never `◀`/`▶`,
  which have emoji presentations and can render as coloured emoji instead of text. The page
  indicator between them stays plain: `Page 2 of 7`.

## Naming a button

A button names the object it acts on, not the internal category that object came from. `/memories`
stores ordinary uploads and captured chat history in the same document table, and both render through
the same panel row, so both remove buttons read `Remove Document`. The two removal routes still differ
underneath, and the confirmation that follows can name the difference where it matters.

The same rule rejects a label that names its own styling, such as `Danger: Remove`. Say what the
button does; let colour, the confirmation, and the surrounding prose supply the rest.

## Button colour

Colour carries a small set of structural meanings rather than decorating important actions.

- **Blue (`Primary`) marks the active category or the selected choice in a direct state-control
  row.** A selected state button is disabled Primary. Available alternatives are enabled
  Secondary, while an unavailable alternative is disabled Secondary.
- **A state-control row contains mutually exclusive stored states or scopes.** Examples are
  `[Off] [On]`, `[Off] [Follow Server] [On]`, and `[Server-wide] [Persona]`. Do not apply this
  treatment to pagination, transient navigation, confirmation, or ordinary action rows.
- **Place effective behavior below the state-control buttons.** Do not repeat the choice with an
  `(On)` or `(Off)` suffix, a coloured-circle status, or a separate `State:` row. The button label,
  disabled selection, and behavior sentence communicate the state without relying on colour alone.
- **Grey (`Secondary`) is the default for actions and red (`Danger`) is destructive.** Green
  (`Success`) is not a button style in this codebase. Coloured circles remain useful in compact
  read-only summaries whose several statuses are edited together elsewhere, such as a modal.
- **Red marks the destructive choice, never the safe one.** In a confirmation pair the action being
  confirmed carries `Danger` where it destroys something, and Cancel stays `Secondary`. A grey
  confirm beside a red Cancel reads as though backing out were the dangerous move.
- **A label never names its own colour.** Write `Remove Prompt`, not `Danger: Remove Prompt`. The red
  already carries the warning, and the label should spend its width on what the button does.

These colour rules cover every Discord surface this bot renders, not only panels: the legacy
confirmation and pagination helpers and the buttons built inline in `src/commands/` follow them too.
`tests/unit/discord/panelButtonColour.test.ts` enforces them by scanning source text, so it reads
style assignments and deliberately skips type annotations and comments. A property type that names a
banned colour is a declaration, not a use; narrow such a union rather than widening it to pass.

## Localization

These rules apply to `src/locales/` prose the same as to any other authored text, including
the dash policy in [`comment-policy.md`](./comment-policy). Prefer literal locale keys:
`check-locales` only matches literal dot-notation strings, so a key composed at runtime can go
missing and still pass every gate, rendering the raw key to the user.
