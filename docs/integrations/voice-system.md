# Voice System

TomoriBot has a bidirectional voice pipeline:

- inbound STT: user audio attachments become text for conversation context
- outbound TTS: personas can send native Discord voice messages

Phase 4 routes both through custom endpoint capabilities:

- `speech` for TTS
- `transcription` for STT

## Commands

- `/speech elevenlabs` connects ElevenLabs speech and transcription in one flow.
- `/config custom-endpoint add` registers local `tts-clone` and `openai-compatible-transcription` endpoints.
- `/config model speech` selects the active TTS endpoint.
- `/config model transcription` selects the active STT endpoint.
- `/speech voice-add` uploads the one server-local reference sample supported in Phase 4.
- `/speech voice-assign` assigns either the local sample or an ElevenLabs voice to a persona.
- `/speech transcripts` controls visible transcript posting in chat. It does not enable or disable background STT.

## Runtime Behavior

The `generate_voice_message` tool appears only when the active persona has a voice assignment compatible with the active speech endpoint.

Audio attachments are transcribed only when a `transcription` endpoint is configured. There is no legacy optional-key fallback after Phase 4.4.
