# Built-In Tool Reference for Prompt Customization

If you customize TomoriBot's system prompt, persona instructions, or external provider prompt templates, prefer the stable prompt macros below instead of hardcoding tool names.

- Prompt macros like `{memory_tool}` are expanded during context assembly. Exact tool names are emitted wrapped in backticks, while unresolved search/fetch families fall back to plain-language text. Static macros always map to the current canonical built-in tool name. Search/fetch family macros resolve to the best currently available exact tool name for the active provider/configuration.
- `Base Tool` means the tool is part of TomoriBot's normal built-in tool set. It may still depend on the current provider/model supporting tool calling.
- Other requirements below are additional gates such as server feature flags, Discord permissions, model capabilities, or optional API keys.
- Admin-added MCP tools are intentionally not listed here because their names depend on each server's configuration.

### Default Search / Web Extras

These are the common built-in or bundled web tools Tomori can expose when web access is enabled. Exact availability depends on provider support, server config, API keys, and which MCP servers are active.

Family macros below may resolve to the listed bundled tools or to compatible guild MCP replacements when admins register their own `web_search` or `url_fetcher` servers.
