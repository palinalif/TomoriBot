title: "TomoriBot Docs Index"
---

The docs site is organized as an audience gradient: curious visitor → user → self-hoster
→ contributor → deep-diver. Sidebar order follows that gradient.

> **Restructure in progress.** Many `introduction/`, `features/`, and `self-hosting/`
> pages are Phase 1 stubs (frontmatter + placeholder). Prose lands in Phase 2: see
> `plans/docs-site-restructure.md`.

## Introduction (order 1)

The marketing front door: what TomoriBot is and how to start using it.

- [`introduction/README.mdx`](./introduction/): hero + feature-card deck (Phase 2)
- [`introduction/quickstart.md`](./introduction/quickstart): invite the public instance or self-host

## Features (order 2)

Capability-oriented pages for people *using* TomoriBot. Category pages with sections;
a section graduates to its own file when it outgrows ~2-3 screens or gains its own setup flow.

Pages are bucketed into task-based sub-categories, each with a landing card-grid README.

- [`architecture/README.md`](./architecture/): code-level overview
- [`architecture/entry-point.md`](./architecture/entry-point): startup and initialization flow

### Pipelines

Per-stage reference. Each folder has a `README.md` (overview + ASCII flow) and numbered stage files.

Supporting services that pipelines depend on.

- [`architecture/subsystems/`](./architecture/subsystems/): database schema, events, commands, tools,
  caching, cooldowns, security, localization, multi-persona, persona-presets, and more

### Integrations

- [`architecture/integrations/`](./architecture/integrations/): Discord platform, Matrix bridge,
  NovelAI, SillyTavern, and voice pipeline internals

### Cloud

Production infrastructure on cloud provider services (Azure, AWS, GCP).

These pages live on the `release` branch under `docs/en/wiki/cloud/`, next to the `terraform/` and
`deploy/` trees they document. A `main` checkout omits them so a self-hoster's clone carries only
the bot. Read one without switching branches:

```bash
git show release:docs/en/wiki/cloud/azure/azure-production-deployment.md
```
